# /masterplan — thin resumable shell (v8)

> v8 clean-core. The DECISIONS live in `lib/*.mjs` behind `bin/masterplan.mjs` (deterministic,
> zero-LLM-token, unit-tested) — this shell only **sequences**. Durable state lives in
> `docs/masterplan/<slug>/` (`state.yml` is the source of truth). CD-7: the shell is the SOLE
> state writer, via `bin` — **never** hand-edit, `Write`, or `Edit` `state.yml` or `events.jsonl`;
> every mutation goes through an `mp` subcommand (`seed`, `set-phase`, `set-status`, `mark-task`,
> `load-plan`, `open-gate`, `clear-gate`, `event`, …). A raw `Write`/`Edit` both violates CD-7 **and** floods the screen with the file diff
> (anti-flood) — `mp` writes the file server-side and returns one terse JSON line. Work goes to
> dedicated agents (`agents/*.md`), the L2 Workflow engine (`workflows/execute.workflow.js`), and
> `superpowers` skills — never run substantive work inline in this context (it holds sequencing state only).

Throughout, **`mp`** denotes `node "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/bin/masterplan.mjs"`. Every decision and
every state write goes through it. **The v9 seam:** `mp` runs the LOCAL git its transactions need
(`record-result`'s split commit, `continue`'s worktree create + recovery reset, `sweep`'s removals —
always `-C`-qualified to loci it derives itself); **network git (`push`, `gh`), every commit outside
those transactions, and all dispatch stay this shell's job.** Results print as JSON on stdout; on a
non-zero exit, read stderr and act on it. **Every run executes in a per-run linked worktree (code) with its
bundle in the MAIN checkout (state); every shell `git` is therefore `-C`-qualified by locus — see the
worktree locus model in §2e (bare `git` is forbidden in this shell).**

## 0 — Boot (every invocation, unconditional)

1. **Version banner — FIRST, before anything else**, even on a compaction-resume / `invoked_skills`
   re-injection (it is the lone CC-2 survivor; build NO enforcement/telemetry apparatus around it):
   run `mp version --args="<verbatim $ARGUMENTS, or empty>" --cwd="<repo root or pwd>"` and print the
   single line it returns.
2. **Host detect.** Run `mp detect-host` with the signals you can observe (`--agent-is-codex` if the
   session identifies the agent as Codex, `--native-tools` if Codex-native tools like `apply_patch`/
   `update_plan` are exposed, `--agents-md` if an `AGENTS.md` is present). If the result's
   `suppressRescue` is true, do NOT dispatch the `codex:codex-rescue` companion anywhere this
   invocation (it would recurse — Codex calling Codex). The same true result is the
   **`codex_host_suppressed`** condition the downstream paths check: it gates the Claude-Code-only
   native task tools in the §2 `probe` ops (liveness/reap recovery) and supplies
   `mp continue --codex-suppressed`. Persisted `codex.routing`/`codex.review` are
   unaffected.

## 1 — Parse the verb

Reserved verbs: `full, brainstorm, plan, execute, finish, retro, import, doctor, status, validate,
stats, clean, next, verbs, publish, follow`. Precedence:

0. **No args** → the **resume controller** (§2).
1. First token is a reserved verb → that verb; consume it, the rest are its args.
2. First arg starts with `--` → `--resume=<path>` / `--resume <path>` alias `execute <path>`;
   other `--flags` are config overrides.
3. Otherwise → treat the whole arg string as a **brainstorm topic** (catch-all).

A topic literally named after a reserved verb needs a word in front (`/masterplan add plan timer`).

## 2 — Resume controller (bare entry, `execute`, and after every durable transition)

The spine, now a TRAMPOLINE: locate the bundle, call `mp continue`, and execute the ONE typed op it
returns — re-invoking until an op closes the turn. `mp continue` internalizes what used to be prose
here: Guard D acquire + confirm (every entry; the per-entry re-acquire IS the open-turn heartbeat,
§2e¶8), migrate-on-load (with a `<state>.v<N>.bak` backup), wave backfill from `plan.index.json`,
worktree create-or-reuse (§2e¶4), the crash-recovery scope reset, the phase-1 `active_run` marker
(frozen F-SCOPE `scope` + D6 `baseline`), per-task routing (`routeTask`), and the inline
`finalize_run` reconcile (the same `mp record-result --reconcile` transaction). It runs the LOCAL git
those steps need itself (`-C`-qualified to loci it derives); the shell keeps Workflow/Agent/skill
dispatch, every `AskUserQuestion`, and ALL network ops (`git push`, `gh`, codex-companion).

1. **Derive MAIN, then locate the bundle.** **MAIN must be derived FIRST** (§2e¶1:
   `MAIN="$(dirname "$(git rev-parse --path-format=absolute --git-common-dir)")"` — the sole
   sanctioned bare git) — the discovery glob and every bundle path depend on it, and cwd may already
   be a linked worktree. Then: `execute <path>` → that `state.yml`. Else discover
   `<MAIN>/docs/masterplan/*/state.yml` (absolute-MAIN, §2e¶1) whose status is not archived: exactly
   one → use it; several → an `AskUserQuestion` picker; none → there is no active run (route by
   verb, or offer to start one).
2. **Session sweep — first §2 entry per session, MAIN-only (§2e¶5).** `mp sweep --repo-root="<MAIN>"
   --apply` — classification AND execution live in the subcommand (dry-run is its bare default; the
   session sweep applies per the Q2 contract: auto repair/prune/remove/normalize, trust the
   classifier's proof-gate). `manual` entries return in `skipped` — surface them as WARNs, take NO
   automated action. Skip the sweep on later §2 entries this session.
3. **Catch a completion first.** If a Workflow completion notification re-invoked you and its
   `<result>{…}</result>` (run/task matching `active_run`) is in front of you → do NOT call
   `continue` yet: run the **completion protocol — §2a for an execute wave, §2b for a planning run**
   (branch on `active_run.kind`). Recording BEFORE `continue` is load-bearing — a finished run whose
   tasks are still `pending` on disk looks like a crash (→ a re-dispatch of a wave you already hold
   results for). Then fall through to step 4.
4. **The loop.** `mp continue --state=<MAIN>/docs/masterplan/<slug>/state.yml [--alive|--dead]
   [--stale-reconciled] [--force] [--codex-suppressed]` → ONE op JSON. Execute it per the table;
   `probe` ops re-invoke `continue` with the answer, everything else ends the loop. Pass
   `--codex-suppressed` when §0 host-detect set `suppressRescue`. A non-zero exit is a loud
   invariant — read stderr (e.g. `phase is 'execute' but tasks is empty` → the plan was never
   loaded: `mp seed-tasks --state=<path> --plan-index=<path>`, then re-enter).

   | op | do |
   |---|---|
   | `launch_workflow` | `cd "<op.cwd>"` FIRST — the write-only cwd signal the about-to-launch agents inherit (§2e¶3); never read cwd back. Launch `workflows/<op.workflow>.workflow.js` in the BACKGROUND via the Workflow tool with `args = op.args` (`workflow:'plan'` carries no args — supply `{ subsystems, specPath, repoRoot }` from §3a/§2b, re-dispatching `mp-spec-decomposer` first if the decomposition isn't in hand). Then `mp promote-active-run --state=<path> --run-id=<id> --task-id=<id>` (the op's `next`) and close to await the completion notification. Do NOT mark tasks or commit here — the engine has them in flight. |
   | `dispatch_foreground` | The `--codex-suppressed` wave path (Residual 3B — a suppressed host has no Workflow tool). `cd "<op.cwd>"` FIRST (same §2e¶3 signal), then run `op.tasks` **sequentially in this session** — Codex: implement each task inline, tracking via `update_plan`; Claude Code fallback: one `masterplan:mp-implementer` Agent per task, awaited one at a time, brief = the task's payload (same shape the workflow dispatches). Honor each task's `files` scope. Assemble the standard result `{wave: op.wave, baseline: op.baseline, tasks: [{task_id, digest:{task_id, status:'done'\|'failed'\|'qctl', summary, files_changed, blockers}}]}`, write it to a scratch file OUTSIDE the bundle dir, then `mp record-result --state=<path> --result-file=<scratch>` and act per §2a step 2. NO promote, NO probe — there is no background task; a crash mid-wave re-emits this op on the next `continue` (agents never commit, so re-running is idempotent). |
   | `probe` `kind:'alive'` | `TaskGet(op.task_id)`: still running → re-invoke `continue --alive` (→ `stop wait`); finished/absent with no result in hand (compaction dropped the notification) → `continue --dead` (recovery is idempotent — agents never commit). |
   | `probe` `kind:'reap'` | A dead session's backgrounded Workflow MAY still be running: `TaskList` → `TaskStop` any surviving run for `op.task_id` (**Claude Code only** — no-op when `codex_host_suppressed`, where native task tools are absent), then re-invoke `continue --dead --stale-reconciled` — `continue` then resets the wave scope in WT and re-launches. |
   | `ask` `ask:'gate'` | Re-render the durable gate's `AskUserQuestion` (CD-9). **Finalization gates** (`verification_failed` / `no_verification_command` / `branch_finish`): re-render via `mp finish-step --state=<path>` — its `ask:'gate'` op carries the full payload (incl. the rehydrated codex digest for `branch_finish`) — and act per the **§2c** answer flags (the clear-gate + bundle commit run inside the subcommand). Other gates: named option → act, `mp clear-gate`, `git -C "<MAIN>"` commit the bundle, re-enter the loop. Free-text / no clear answer → keep the gate, respond, close. NEVER auto-proceed regardless of autonomy (the durable marker outranks a native AUQ that can't survive compaction). |
   | `ask` `ask:'owner-blocked'` \| `'owner-lost'` | Guard D (§2e¶8): another live session owns — or mid-turn took over — this bundle; NOTHING was written. AUQ with the incumbent's `host`/`session`: **Take over (force)** → re-invoke `continue --force` · **Abort** → close without touching the bundle · **Read-only** → answer/inspect, NO mutations or dispatches. NEVER auto-force regardless of autonomy. |
   | `ask` `ask:'legacy-refused'` | Pre-5.0 / unparseable legacy (the deliberate R3 refusal; `op.backup` holds the untouched original). Do NOT raw-rewrite `state.yml` (CD-7) — `mp seed` a FRESH bundle (re-deriving tasks via §3), finish the run under masterplan v7, or stop and ask. |
   | `ask` `ask:'waves-unbackfillable'` | Tasks carry `wave:null` and `plan.index.json` is missing/insufficient. Re-derive the index (re-parse `plan.md` via the `masterplan:mp-planner` agent), then re-enter the loop — `continue` backfills durably itself. |
   | `ask` `ask:'dispatch-error'` \| `'decide-error'` | A loud invariant fired (plan/state file-set drift, missing plan.index entry, decide-loop exhaustion). Surface `op.error` via AUQ — never paper over a thrown invariant. |
   | `run_skill` `skill:'resume-phase'` | Mid-`{brainstorm\|plan}` with no plan built (`tasks:[]`). **Do NOT finalize/archive.** `phase==plan` → the plan lifecycle (**§3a**) with `op.planning_mode`. `phase==brainstorm` → re-entering a live brainstorm stays deferred: AUQ continue / restart / stop. |
   | `run_skill` `skill:'finish'` | All execute tasks done → the **finalization flow (§2c)**: drive `mp finish-step` one op per call — verify-before-completion (cite output) → `retro.md` → durable `branch_finish` gate → archive **LAST**. NEVER a silent archive. |
   | `stop` `reason:'wait'` | A live run owns the wave. Report it and close — its completion notification re-invokes this controller (→ step 3). |
   | `stop` (coordination) | `publish_needed` / `coordinate` → the §7 coordination playbook, with the op's facts. |

5. **CD-7 commit discipline.** Each durable change = an `mp` write (atomic) FOLLOWED BY a `git
   commit` — **bundle** commits `git -C "<MAIN>"`, **code** commits `git -C "<WT>"` (the split
   commit, §2e¶6) — never one mixed `commit -am`. On the wave path BOTH sides run inside
   `mp record-result`; `mp continue` writes state (markers, backfill, worktree record) but never
   commits — its writes are swept into the next state commit, and a crash between write and commit
   is safe (`state.yml` leads, resume re-commits). Wave members (agents / the L2 engine) return
   digests only; they NEVER write `state.yml` or commit, which is exactly what makes re-dispatch
   idempotent.

## 2a — Wave completion protocol (the L1↔L2 seam)

`workflows/execute.workflow.js` (L2) runs **exactly one wave per launch**; the LAUNCH half now lives
inside `mp continue` (§2): it resolves routing (`routeTask`) + the frozen F-SCOPE `scope`, captures
the D6 baseline, ensures the worktree (create-or-reuse, §2e¶4), writes the phase-1 marker, and
returns the `launch_workflow` op the shell executes (`cd "<WT>"` → background Workflow → promote →
close). A Workflow script has no module/fs/git access — the op threads data in via `args`; the
workflow itself only dispatches agents and echoes the baseline. This section is the RESULT half:
what to do when the engine's completion notification re-invokes the controller (§2 step 3).

**Completion** (re-invoked holding the engine's `<result>` — reached from §2 step 3):

The whole record transaction is ONE subcommand — heartbeat → mark digests → D6 verify-scope →
out-of-scope revert → split commit (code→WT, state→MAIN) → marker clear (iff the whole wave is done)
→ the `next` advisory — implemented in `lib/wave-commit.mjs`, crash-safe at every prefix (any crash resumes
via `mp continue`'s inline `finalize_run` reconcile — the same transaction, `--reconcile` mode):

1. **Record.** Write the engine's whole `<result>` JSON to a scratch file OUTSIDE the bundle dir
   (e.g. `/tmp/mp-result-<slug>.json` — a bundle-dir scratch would be swept into the state commit),
   then `mp record-result --state=<path> --result-file=<that file>`.
2. **Act on the returned JSON.**
   - `outcome:'lost-to-other'` → NOTHING was written; a second session took this bundle over while
     our wave ran. **STOP** — surface the takeover via `AskUserQuestion` (reclaim via
     `mp acquire-owner --force`, or abandon this session's recording) (Guard D, §2e¶8).
   - `failed[]` / `qctl[]` / `blocking_reviews[]` non-empty → surface via `AskUserQuestion` (§4) —
     never silently loop. Failed/blocked tasks stay `pending` with the marker intact; `next` is
     `recover_and_redispatch` for ONLY those. `qctl` tasks hand to §6.
   - `scope.ok:false` → the offenders were already reverted in WT (`reverted[]`); surface the
     breach. In-scope work stands.
   - Otherwise **narrate tersely** — at most a 1–2 line wave summary (what completed / what's
     next), NEVER the `state.yml` or `WORKLOG.md` diff (anti-flood) — and **re-enter the §2 loop**
     (step 4): `mp continue` derives the next op itself (the next wave's `launch_workflow`, or
     `run_skill finish`).

## 2b — Parallel-plan dispatch + completion (the planning L1↔L2 seam)

`workflows/plan.workflow.js` (L2) fans out **one `mp-subsystem-planner` per subsystem** in a single
parallel barrier and returns **fragments only** — it never writes artifacts or commits. This shell
owns the decomposition (the subsystem list), the deterministic merge, and the gate. It mirrors §2a
**minus the wave loop and minus any scope capture** — the drafters are read-only, so there is no D6
baseline and no `verify-scope`. `active_run.kind:'plan'` carries **no wave**.

**Launch** (reached from §3a's parallel branch, and from crash recovery):

1. **Subsystems in hand.** Use the decomposition from §3a (`mp-spec-decomposer`'s `{subsystems}`). On
   a recovery re-entry with none in hand, re-dispatch `mp-spec-decomposer` first — the fan-out is
   idempotent, so re-deriving the seam map is safe.
2. **Phase-1 plan marker.** `mp set-active-run --state=<path> --kind=plan` — a planning marker (no
   wave) written BEFORE launch so a crash in the launch gap resumes as recovery, not a blind
   re-dispatch.
3. **Re-enter the §2 loop.** `mp continue` now returns the `launch_workflow workflow:'plan'` op —
   per the §2 table: launch `workflows/plan.workflow.js` in the background with
   `args = { subsystems:<step 1>, specPath:<spec_path>, repoRoot:<repo> }`, promote the handles
   (`mp promote-active-run --run-id=<id> --task-id=<id>`), close to await the completion
   notification (→ §2 step 3 → here). Do NOT merge or commit here — the fan-out is in flight.

**Completion** (re-invoked holding the engine's `<result>` = `{ subsystems:[…fragments…], specPath,
repoRoot }`, reached from §2 step 3 when `active_run.kind==='plan'`):

1. **Reconcile coverage.** Diff the returned fragment `key`s against the requested subsystem keys;
   **surface any missing subsystem** (a drafter that errored/skipped nulls out — never fake it). A
   missing drafter is a `REVISE`-class gate, not a silent drop.
2. **Stage the fragments.** Write the returned `subsystems` array to
   `<MAIN>/docs/masterplan/<slug>/.plan-fragments.json` (absolute-MAIN, §2e¶1 — the bundle lives in
   MAIN even when cwd is a worktree; a plain `Write` — `plan.index.json` / `plan.md` / fragments are
   **ARTIFACTS, not CD-7 state**, so this write is allowed outside the `mp`-only rule).
3. **Merge (deterministic).** `mp merge-plan-fragments --fragments=<MAIN>/docs/masterplan/<slug>/.plan-fragments.json
   --out=<plan_index_path> --plan-md=<plan_path> --meta='{"title":"<topic>","spec":"<spec_path>"}'` —
   assigns global ids/waves, normalises `codex`, **validates BEFORE writing**, and stamps
   `plan_hash`/`generated_at` onto both artifacts. A merge error (dup key, dangling/cyclic dep, invalid
   index) exits non-zero and writes nothing — surface it and stop.
4. **Explicit gate.** `mp validate-plan-index --plan-index=<plan_index_path>` — the standalone strict
   check, the compensating layer now that fragments crossed a background-Workflow boundary (the
   `FRAGMENT` tool-schema enum guarded the foreground path; this re-guards `codex` shape + same-wave
   file-disjointness on disk).
5. **Review.** Dispatch `agents/mp-plan-reviewer` against `plan.md` / `plan.index.json` / `spec.md`
   → `PASS | REVISE | FAIL`.
   - **PASS** → `mp clear-active-run`; **`mp load-plan --state=<path> --plan-index=<plan_index_path>`**
     (materializes `state.tasks` from the plan **and** advances `phase→execute` in one atomic write — the
     plan→execute seam; a bare `set-phase execute` would leave `tasks:[]`, so the next `decide` would
     `complete`→archive the just-planned bundle) + `mp event --state=<path> --type=phase_transition
     --phase=execute`; `git -C "<MAIN>"` commit `plan.index.json` + `plan.md` + `state.yml` together
     (all bundle artifacts, MAIN-resident, §2e¶2; terse 1–2 line narration, never the diff — anti-flood);
     then re-enter the §2 loop (step 4 — `mp continue` returns the wave-1 `launch_workflow` op,
     creating-or-reusing the worktree itself, §2e¶4).
   - **REVISE / FAIL** (or a missing subsystem from step 1) → `mp clear-active-run`; surface the
     reviewer's findings via `AskUserQuestion` (§4) — revise-and-replan / accept-as-is (REVISE only) /
     stop — and keep `phase=plan`. Never auto-advance past a non-PASS verdict.

## 2c — Finalization flow (the `complete` action + the `finish` verb — `mp finish-step`)

`complete` is no longer a silent archive — it is the umbrella **finish** flow: verify the work (and
cite it), write the retro, then surface a **durable** `branch_finish` gate before archiving. The
state machine lives in **`mp finish-step`** (`lib/finish-step.mjs`) — a re-entrant trampoline, the §2
pattern: the shell calls it, executes the ONE op returned, and re-calls with the answer threaded back
as flags. Every durable transaction — verified-SHA record, gate open/clear, the codex events, merge +
worktree teardown + disposition, archive + owner release, and the bundle commits bracketing them —
runs INSIDE the subcommand; the shell keeps only the genuinely-LLM/network work: running verification
(skill), writing the retro, running the codex-companion review, the PR probe, the push, and the AUQs.
**Archive is LAST** and reachable only through a retired disposition — archiving earlier strands the
run (the §2-step-1 discover filter hides archived bundles, so the gate could never re-surface; the
one thing v7's flow got wrong).

**Loop:** `mp finish-step --state=<MAIN>/docs/masterplan/<slug>/state.yml [answer flags]
[--codex-suppressed]` (pass `--codex-suppressed` when §0 host-detect set `suppressRescue` — Codex
hosting the command must not review-via-Codex; that recurses). It handles with NO prose steps: Guard D
acquire/heartbeat (`owner-blocked`/`owner-lost` mirror §2's rows), the retired-disposition re-entry
shortcut (MAIN-side, NO WT git — the teardown removes `<WT>` before archive, so a WT snapshot there
would die; the Codex P1), the WT snapshot, the task-scope dirty-commit (unrelated dirt untouched —
protect-user-work; committing moves HEAD, so the verified check re-keys automatically), the
verified-at-SHA skip, retro write-if-absent gating, the durable sha-keyed codex-review re-entry guard
(`codex_review` / `codex_review_skipped` events), the `branch_finish` gate open + resolution
transaction, and archive + release-owner. A compaction at ANY point resumes cleanly: re-invoke with no
answer flags and the same op (or the open gate) comes back.

| op | do (then re-invoke `mp finish-step` with the answer flag) |
|---|---|
| `run_verify` `{commands, head, wt}` | `superpowers:verification-before-completion`: RUN fresh, **cite real output + exit code** (CD-3; "should pass" is not evidence). Command source: `op.commands` (the union of the plan tasks' `verify_commands`); if empty, the skill's own IDENTIFY; if STILL none under `--autonomy=full`, `mp open-gate --id=no_verification_command` + AUQ (specify one / proceed without) — never silently skip. PASS → re-invoke with `--verify-passed` (records the SHA durably; a re-entry at unchanged HEAD skips the re-run). FAIL → `--verify-failed` (opens the durable `verification_failed` gate; the returned `ask` is the turn-close). |
| `write_retro` `{path, retro_only?}` | Generate `retro.md` at `op.path` (write-if-absent — finish-step re-checks the fs, so a re-entry skips it). Then re-invoke with no new flags. Subsumes the old `retro` verb. |
| `run_codex_review` `{base, head, wt, digest_path}` | The whole-branch cross-vendor review — network, stays shell-side. Resolve the script (`mp codex-companion-path` → `{resolved, exists, path}`), then run foreground from WT bounded by an OUTER `timeout` ceiling above the companion's internal 240 s status-wait so a network hang can never wedge finish: `( cd "<op.wt>" && timeout 600 node "<path>" review --scope branch --base <op.base> )`. **Fail-soft, never wedge finish:** ANY non-success — non-zero exit, `timeout`'s `124`, unresolved/missing path — → `--codex-skipped --codex-reason="<tight reason>"`; finish-step writes the sha-keyed skip event whose hyphenated "codex-companion … skipped" summary deliberately does NOT match the audit's `\bcodex\s+review\b`, so a degraded finish still trips `codex_review_configured_but_zero_invocations` — correct. On **exit 0**: `Write` a brief digest (count + top findings, not the raw dump) to `op.digest_path` (absolute-MAIN, §2e¶1; the Write tool is not shell-evaluated, so arbitrary review bytes are safe — never interpolate the digest into a shell word), then `--codex-done --codex-count=<n> --codex-base=<op.base> --codex-digest-file=<op.digest_path>` — finish-step emits the durable `codex_review` event (its `summary` is the audit signal that DOES match `\bcodex\s+review\b`; `data.sha/base/count` are the quote-safe machine scalars the re-entry guard keys on; `note` carries the digest verbatim for gate rehydration). Residual window: a death between the reviewer's exit 0 and the re-invoke leaves no record at HEAD, so resume re-runs the review — harmless and idempotent at an unchanged tree. |
| `ask` `ask:'gate'` `gate:'branch_finish'` `{head, branch, base, dispositions, codex}` | First **probe for an open PR** (the §3 probe: `gh pr list --head "<op.branch>" … \| mp pr-summary`). AUQ labelled with `op.base`: `Merge to <base> locally (Recommended)` · `Push and open a PR` · `Keep branch + worktree as-is` · `Discard everything` (typed "discard" required). If the probe found a PR (`hasPr`), relabel the second option → `View / merge open PR #<n> (mergeable: <yes\|no\|unknown>)` — same `pr` choice; its resolution is a no-op push surfacing the existing PR's URL, never a second one. Fold `op.codex` (`{present, digest, count, base}`, rehydrated from the durable event — the live in-context digest does not survive compaction, the event does) into the AUQ when present. This AUQ is the turn-close. Resolution = re-invoke with `--choice=<merge\|pr\|keep\|discard>` (add `--removal-force` only for an intended-dirty teardown): finish-step runs the disposition transaction (§2e¶7) and archives — except `pr`, which first returns the `shell push_pr` op (two-phase: archive happens only after `--choice=pr --pushed`). A free-text / "not ready" answer holds the gate and chats (§2 `ask:'gate'` rule) — the "not done yet" escape, nothing archives. |
| `ask` `ask:'gate'` `gate:'verification_failed'` (and `no_verification_command`, shell-opened above) | AUQ: *Fix first & re-run* → `mp clear-gate`, close (fix code + commit, then resume → verification re-runs fresh and re-opens the gate if still red). *Proceed anyway (reviewed)* → `--verify-passed` — the reviewed override records the SHA AND clears the gate, so a re-entry doesn't re-loop the same failure. *Abort finish* → `mp clear-gate`, close (the run stays resumable; nothing archived). For `no_verification_command`: *Specify a command* → RUN it fresh, **cite output** (CD-3) → PASS = `--verify-passed`, FAIL = `--verify-failed`; *Proceed without* = `--verify-passed` (the reviewed "no verification available" override). Never silently skip verification or archive. |
| `ask` `ask:'owner-blocked'` \| `'owner-lost'` | Guard D (§2e¶8) — same acts as the §2 rows: take over (`--force`) / abort / read-only. NEVER auto-force regardless of autonomy. |
| `ask` `ask:'dispatch-error'` | A loud invariant: WT missing without a retired disposition (reconcile via `mp sweep`); merge target mismatch (MAIN has a non-base branch checked out — switch MAIN to the base and re-issue `--choice=merge`; finish-step never checks out the user's MAIN itself); merge conflict (already aborted — MAIN left clean, the gate stays open); worktree removal failed (disposition stays `active`, reaped by the next sweep — or re-run with `--removal-force`). Surface `op.error` via AUQ — never paper over. |
| `shell` `{kind:'push_pr', branch, base, wt}` | The network half of the `pr` choice — phase 1 of a two-phase handshake: NOTHING durable has changed yet (gate still open, disposition still `active`), so a death here re-renders `branch_finish` instead of silently archiving with no PR. Run `git -C "<op.wt>" push -u origin <op.branch>` then `gh pr create --base <op.base> …` — or, when the probe found an open PR, the push is a fast-forward no-op and no second PR is opened; surface the existing URL. On success re-invoke with `--choice=pr --pushed` — phase 2 retires (`kept_by_user`), clears the gate, and archives. On push/PR failure just re-invoke bare: the gate re-renders and the AUQ surfaces the error. |
| `stop` `reason:'archived'` | Done — owner lock released, the §2 discover filter now hides the bundle, the run goes quiet. Narrate 1–2 lines. |
| `stop` `reason:'retro_done'` | The `--retro-only` terminal: retro exists; nothing archived, no gates. |

**Manual entry — `/masterplan finish`.** Bare `finish` locates the bundle and `mp decide`s: `complete`
→ drive this loop; tasks still pending (or a run live) → AUQ "N task(s) pending — finalize anyway?
(→ §2c) / keep working (→ §2) / just re-write the retro (→ `--retro-only`)" — never silent-archive an
incomplete run. `finish --retro-only` passes `--retro-only` (retro write-if-absent → `retro_done`; the
old `retro` behavior — never archives, never gates).

## 2d — Autonomy contract (loose / full — when a turn may auto-progress)

`state.autonomy` governs exactly ONE thing: whether a turn that finished useful work but hit **no
gate** may close **silently** (auto-progress) or must end with an `AskUserQuestion`. It does **not**
widen, narrow, or skip any gate — the gate set is identical at every autonomy level (`decide` doesn't
read `autonomy`; it only ever returns real actions). Under `autonomy ∈ {loose, full}` the orchestrator
**auto-progresses** and does NOT manufacture an end-of-turn question.

**The COMPLETE stop-set** — the *only* things that may end a turn with an AUQ under loose/full; if the
turn hit none of these, it MUST auto-progress, not ask:

- The §2 `ask:'gate'` op for any durable gate: `branch_finish`, `verification_failed`, `no_verification_command`.
- A spec/plan **review FAIL** or a missing-subsystem REVISE (§2b step 5 / §3a).
- A wave that surfaced a **failure** — a `failed`/`blocked` task or a `blocking` review verdict (§2a
  completion) — or **blocker re-engagement** after the CD-4 ladder fails its rungs.
- Re-entering an **in-progress brainstorm** (`run_skill resume-phase`, `phase==brainstorm`): continue / restart / stop.
- The §2-step-1 **multi-bundle discover picker**, and the bare-`finish` **pending-tasks** prompt
  (finalize anyway / keep working / `--retro-only`, §2c manual entry) — both genuine "which path?" forks.
- An explicit **risky-action** confirmation: push / merge / discard / force / external message / secrets.

**Explicitly forbidden** orchestrator-added asks (these ARE the over-asking the contract kills — never
emit them under loose/full):

<!-- cd9-exempt: this list QUOTES forbidden asks as anti-pattern examples to ban them; it does not emit them. -->

- "Run codex or not?" — routing is decided inside `mp continue` (`routeTask`), never by asking.
- "What should I do next?" / "dispatch the next wave?" — between successful steps you **auto-proceed**:
  `mp record-result` → dispatch the next wave **in the same turn** (§2a completion → execute `next`).
- Per-small-task "looks good?" / "shall I continue?" confirmations.
- "Ready for Wave N" / "awaiting completion" / "status this turn:" ceremonial closers.

**Carve-out marker.** On an **auto-progress turn** — work done, the §2 loop returned a non-gate op
(`launch_workflow` / `probe` / `stop wait` / a committed + reconciled wave) and you are closing
**without** an AUQ — end the turn's text with the literal token
**`<mp-autoprogress>`**. The global Stop guard
(`~/.claude/hooks/auq-guard.sh`) stands down when it sees this marker, so it won't force a ceremonial
AUQ onto an authorized autonomous turn. **Never** emit it on a turn that surfaces a stop-set gate (the
gate's own AUQ is the turn-close) or when `autonomy` is neither loose nor full. It is a stand-down
signal for *this plugin's* authorized auto-progress, mirroring the user-side `<no-auq>` hatch.

**Turn-close routing (CC-3-trampoline).** Every turn-close in this shell — a stop-set gate's AUQ, an
auto-progress `<mp-autoprogress>` close, or a plain stop — runs the same canonical **CC-3-trampoline**
sequence, defined **here**: emit the turn's summary block + exit breadcrumb **exactly once**, at
turn-close (never per-tool-call — the v7 hook-driven per-turn ceremony is gone, §5), then close with
the right terminator — an `AskUserQuestion` at a stop-set gate (CD-9), or the `<mp-autoprogress>`
marker on an authorized auto-progress (above). The §0 version banner is an *invocation*-time
obligation (first, before anything), **not** part of this turn-close sequence. This router is the
single in-file enforcement point — no phase-file indirection.

## 2e — Worktree locus model (bundle-in-MAIN, code-in-WT — create / sweep / commit / teardown)

Every v8 run executes in a **per-run linked worktree holding code only**; its run bundle stays in the
MAIN checkout. This section DEFINES the two loci, the split commit, and the teardown — and points at
where create (¶4), sweep (¶5), and teardown (¶7) now execute. The compute core is `lib/worktree.mjs`;
create-or-reuse runs inside `mp continue`, the sweep inside `mp sweep`, and the teardown inside
`mp finish-step` (local git in `mp` — the v9 seam).

1. **Two loci, one object store.**
   - **MAIN** = the primary worktree (repo root). Re-derive every turn, cwd-independent:
     `MAIN="$(dirname "$(git rev-parse --path-format=absolute --git-common-dir)")"` (resolves to the
     MAIN repo root from ANY cwd inside it, incl. a linked worktree). The **run bundle**
     `docs/masterplan/<slug>/` ALWAYS lives here, on `base` — never on the run branch. So **every
     bundle path is absolute-MAIN, always, in every section** (edited or not): `--state`,
     `--plan-index`, `--plan-md`, `.plan-fragments.json`, `codex-review-digest.txt`, `retro.md`,
     `--note-file`, and every `mp event/mark-task/open-gate/load-plan/...` target is
     `<MAIN>/docs/masterplan/<slug>/…`.
   - **WT** = `<MAIN>/.worktrees/<slug>`, the per-run **code** worktree on branch `masterplan/<slug>`.
     Holds CODE ONLY — the branch never commits the bundle dir, so `merge masterplan/<slug> → base` at
     finish is conflict-free (base's already-advanced bundle wins; no re-point).
   - Derivations (deterministic, mirror `lib/worktree.mjs`): `WT=<MAIN>/.worktrees/<slug>`;
     `branch=masterplan/<slug>`; `branchExists` ⇔ `git -C "<MAIN>" rev-parse --verify --quiet
     refs/heads/masterplan/<slug>` exits 0.

2. **Every shell git is `-C`-qualified by locus — bare `git` is forbidden in this shell.** Because cwd
   is deliberately moved to WT before each wave (¶3), an un-`-C`'d `git` would hit the wrong locus.
   - **MAIN locus** (`git -C "<MAIN>" …`): bundle discovery, gate-resolution **state** commits, the
     `branchExists` predicate. (The teardown's merge + `worktree remove`, the sweep, and the archive
     commit now run inside `mp` — §2c/¶5/¶7 — with the same `-C` discipline in code.)
   - **WT locus** (`git -C "<WT>" …`): code edits, the D6 `before`/`after` capture, `verify-scope`
     reverts, the **code** commit, and the `pr` push. **Every `git rev-parse HEAD` this shell runs is
     the CODE tip → `git -C "<WT>" rev-parse HEAD`** (the §2c snapshot itself is inside `mp
     finish-step`). The orchestrator's own git NEVER relies on ambient cwd — re-derive
     MAIN→WT→branch from the slug each turn (compaction-safe).
   - **Sole sanctioned bare git:** the ¶1 bootstrap `git rev-parse --path-format=absolute
     --git-common-dir` that *derives* MAIN. It is cwd-independent by construction (it resolves the same
     common git dir from MAIN or any linked worktree), so it cannot be `-C`-qualified — it is the very
     thing that computes the `-C` target. Once MAIN is known, every other git is `-C`-qualified by locus.

3. **cwd is a WRITE-ONLY signal to the about-to-launch agents — never read it back.** Subagents (both
   Agent-tool and Workflow-spawned) inherit the orchestrator's POST-`cd` cwd. So immediately before
   each L2 wave launch, `cd "<WT>"` — the implementers then inherit cwd=WT and their relative-path
   edits land on `masterplan/<slug>`. The shell NEVER reads cwd back to decide a locus (every shell git
   is explicit-`-C`, ¶2). `execute.workflow.js`'s "your launch cwd IS the target repo (${repoRoot})"
   holds iff we cd'd to WT and pass `repoRoot:<WT>` in the launch args.

4. **Create-or-reuse — internalized in `mp continue`.** The worktree probe (`branchExists` +
   `worktreeRegistered`, the crash-between-`add`-and-record guard), the `git worktree add`, and the
   durable `state.worktree` record all run inside `mp continue` before each launch op
   (`lib/continue.mjs` `ensureWorktree`, composing `lib/worktree.mjs` `planWorktreeCreate`). The
   shell never creates a run worktree by hand; teardown is likewise internalized (¶7, inside
   `mp finish-step` — `mp worktree record --choice=…` stays as the manual out-of-band recorder).

5. **Global orphan sweep — `mp sweep`, once per SESSION at first §2 entry (a dead run can't reap
   itself).** Teardown for an abandoned/crashed run is done by the NEXT live runner. Classification
   (the proof-gated ladder in `lib/worktree.mjs`) and execution both live in the subcommand: dry-run
   by default (report-only), `--apply` executes repair / prune / `worktree remove --force` (a
   registered crash-leak of OUR retired bundle) / `rm -rf` + prune (a PROVABLY-foreign leftover) /
   the durable `normalize` state rewrite. `manual` is NEVER automated in either mode (the proof-gate
   deliberately withholds the unprovable cases — `foreign-unverified`, `active-unregistered`,
   `duplicate-ownership`; the live `.worktrees/cc3-visibility` orphan classifies `foreign-unverified`
   → manual → stays human-gated) — surface its `skipped` entries as WARNs. This is the only
   crash-leak reaper; only the sweep is session-gated (re-running it every wave is wasteful + noisy).

6. **Split commit — state and code commit SEPARATELY, to two loci/branches.**
   - **Code** → WT, path-scoped to the wave's in-scope files ONLY — NEVER `add -A` / `commit -am`
     (WT's frozen bundle-dir checkout, if present, must not be swept into the branch).
   - **State** → `docs/masterplan/<slug>` in MAIN (Guard D sentinels excluded by pathspec).
   - On the wave path BOTH commits execute inside `mp record-result` (`lib/wave-commit.mjs`). The
     LEADING durable action is its atomic state WRITE, then code commit (WT), then state commit
     (MAIN) — so any crash prefix re-derives: `mp continue` re-runs the tail inline (the
     `finalize_run` reconcile: `mp record-result --reconcile`) off the persisted
     `active_run.{scope,baseline}` (a clean WT no-ops down to the marker clear). On the finish path
     the same two-loci discipline runs inside `mp finish-step` (§2c) — the task-scope dirty-commit in
     WT, the gate/archive bundle commits in MAIN.

7. **Teardown — internalized in `mp finish-step` (§2c).** The `--choice` resolution transaction runs
   the disposition git in MAIN — for merge, only after the target guard passes (MAIN's checked-out
   branch must equal the detected base; mismatch → `dispatch-error`, nothing merged) — `merge
   --no-edit masterplan/<slug>` (a conflict aborts cleanly and surfaces as `dispatch-error`; the gate
   stays open), then for merge / discard `worktree remove "<WT>"` (`--force` only on discard or an
   explicit `--removal-force`; an already-absent WT path counts as removal-confirmed — `worktree
   prune` reconciles git's metadata — so a crash between remove and record retires cleanly on replay)
   and a best-effort branch retire (`-d` after merge, `-D` on discard). keep / pr → no removal. The
   disposition is recorded from the ACTUAL removal outcome via `dispositionAfterTeardown(choice,
   confirmed)`: merge/discard + confirmed → `removed_after_merge`; keep/pr → `kept_by_user`;
   merge/discard + NOT confirmed → `active` (teardown retried on the next sweep — never the phantom
   `missing`). The recorded retirement value is what arms the §2c re-entry guard, so a replayed
   `--choice` never re-runs the action. Only the network half (push + PR) returns to the shell, as
   the `shell push_pr` op — and `pr` retires nothing until the shell confirms with `--pushed`.
   `mp worktree record --choice=…` remains available as the manual recorder for out-of-band teardowns.

8. **Owner sentinel — Guard D, cross-session mutual exclusion (NFS-safe).** Two sessions (possibly on
   different NFS clients — epyc1/epyc2) must not operate the SAME bundle concurrently. `writeState` is an
   atomic WRITE, not a test-and-set, so a `state.yml` owner *field* can't lock; Guard D is a SEPARATE
   sentinel (`<MAIN>/docs/masterplan/<slug>/.owner.lock` + per-owner `.owner.hb.<host>.<session>`),
   created by an atomic `link()` and confirmed via `stat().nlink` — all FILESYSTEM ops in `mp` (no git,
   no CD-7 conflict; the lock is NOT state.yml). The identity is the **LLM session** (`CLAUDE_CODE_SESSION_ID`),
   not the ephemeral `mp` process — stable across this session's turns, so the gate is idempotent.
   - **Acquire** at kickoff — inside `mp continue` (every §2 entry with an active bundle; `blocked` →
     the §2 `ask:'owner-blocked'` AUQ; the per-entry re-acquire doubles as the open-turn heartbeat).
   - **Heartbeat** before the state-mutating completion — executed INSIDE `mp record-result` (step 0
     of its transaction; `lost-to-other` → it returns with zero writes, a second session took over).
   - **Release** at finish — inside `mp finish-step`'s archive transaction (§2c), after the archive
     commit (frees the bundle so no successor is blocked).
   - **Liveness is heartbeat-age TTL only** (default 30m, must exceed the max single background wave — an
     LLM session is not a probeable process, so there is no same-host PID check). A crashed session's
     lock ages out after the TTL and the next acquirer `steal`s it; the `owner-sentinel` doctor check
     WARNs on a stale/corrupt lock (or an orphan heartbeat) and recommends `mp release-owner --force`.
   - `--force` (on acquire or release) is the human takeover — never auto-invoked under any autonomy.
   - **Guarantee (and its honest limit).** Guard D gives PERFECT mutual exclusion for **live** contention —
     a fresh contended lock is an atomic `link()` create, so two live sessions never both proceed. The unit
     of protection is the **turn** (re-heartbeat inside `mp continue` / `mp record-result`), not the individual write. The one
     residual, accepted by design (perfect single-writer is impossible on NFS without a lock manager): a
     `>TTL`-abandoned owner that resurrects at the exact instant a reclaimer breaks its lock. Narrow, benign,
     documented — NOT a gap to close with another mechanism.

## 3 — Other verbs (sequencing only — content lives elsewhere)

| verb | v8 target |
|---|---|
| `full` / `brainstorm` / `plan` | Locate the bundle, or **seed a new one** — `mp seed --state=<path> --slug=<slug> --topic="<topic>" [--complexity=… --autonomy=… --planning-mode=serial\|parallel\|auto --predecessor-transcript=…]` (writes a valid v8 brainstorm-phase bundle; refuses an existing one unless `--force`). **Brainstorm:** invoke `superpowers:brainstorming` directly; on spec approval, `mp set-phase --state=<path> --phase=plan` + `mp event --state=<path> --type=phase_transition --phase=plan` (never hand-edit `state.yml` — CD-7). **Plan:** hand to the **plan lifecycle (§3a)**, which selects serial vs parallel per `planning.mode`, then materializes `state.tasks` **and** advances `phase→execute` in one atomic `mp load-plan` write (the plan→execute seam; the lower-level `mp seed-tasks` populates tasks *without* touching phase, for recovering an already-`execute` bundle). The seam is guard-enforced: `mp set-phase --phase=execute` refuses a 0-task bundle without `--force`, and `decide` *throws* on a `phase:execute` + `tasks:[]` bundle rather than finalizing an unseeded run — so a bare `set-phase execute` can never silently archive a planned-but-unseeded run. Log other milestones with `mp event …`; gates via `mp open-gate` + an `AskUserQuestion`. (`brainstorm` stops once the plan phase is reached; `plan` runs §3a; `full` continues through execution via §2.) |
| `execute` | The resume controller (§2). |
| `finish` | The finalization verb → the flow in **§2c** (verify → retro → durable `branch_finish` gate → archive **LAST**). Bare `finish` = run §2c (on pending tasks, AUQ "finalize anyway / keep working / `--retro-only`" — never silent-archive an incomplete run). `finish --retro-only` = (re)generate `retro.md` only — no verification, no gate, no archive (the old `retro` behavior); safe on an in-progress or finished run, and it must NOT `set-status archived` (that would strand a run: the §2 discover filter hides archived bundles). |
| `retro` | Deprecated alias for `finish --retro-only`. Print a one-line "`retro` was renamed to `finish` (running `finish --retro-only`)" notice, then run it. Kept for muscle-memory/back-compat. |
| `import` | Legacy intake → a v8 bundle: `mp migrate-bundle` an in-place legacy `state.yml` (backs up the original). **On a pre-5.0 refusal the §2 `ask:'legacy-refused'` rule applies: do NOT raw-rewrite `state.yml` (CD-7) — treat the legacy bundle as read-only and `mp seed` a fresh one, finish under v7, or stop and ask.** |
| `doctor` | `node "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/bin/doctor.mjs" [--fix]`. **[checks = step 5.]** |
| `status` | Read-only: `mp decide` (no writes) + a one-screen situation report from `state.yml`. **PR-aware** (PR probe ↓): if the branch has an open PR, append the `↪ Open PR #<n> …` line. |
| `validate` | Parse-check `state.yml` + config; report findings. No writes. |
| `stats` | `jq` roll-up over `events.jsonl` if present (replaces the v7 telemetry scripts). |
| `clean` | Archive (`mp set-status --state=<path> --status=archived`) / prune completed bundles. **PR-aware:** before archiving a bundle whose branch has an open PR, AUQ-**warn** (`bundle <slug>: branch has open PR #<n> — archive anyway?`) — warn, don't hard-block (archiving doesn't touch the PR; the user may still want the bundle gone). |
| `next` | `mp decide` → describe the next action without executing it. **PR-aware:** if the branch has an open PR, append the **advisory** `↪ Open PR #<n> ready — merge on GitHub or via /masterplan finish` (advisory only — never a `decide` action, never a blocking AUQ; this is how "a PR to merge" enters the what-do-I-do-next routine without becoming a per-resume nag). |
| `verbs` | Print the reserved-verb list above. |
| `publish` | **Lead → GitHub coordination** (spec §7 — **IMPLEMENTED-UNVERIFIED**, never dogfooded end-to-end). Full procedure: [`docs/coordination-playbook.md`](../docs/coordination-playbook.md) §publish — bootstrap defaults (`mp set-coord --bootstrap`) → preflight (`mp coord-status --fail-if-unpublishable`) → provision the `mp-coord/<slug>/<plan_hash>` contract ref + `mp-int/<slug>` integration branch → one `gh issue create` per unpublished wave task (`mp gh-issue-body`, `mp update-issue-map`) → `mp set-coord --mark-published` + commit. **Follow the playbook exactly — do not improvise the steps from memory.** |
| `follow` | **Follower session → claim + deliver one task** (spec §7 — same playbook, same caveat). Full procedure: [`docs/coordination-playbook.md`](../docs/coordination-playbook.md) §follow — preflight → claim (`mp select-claimable`, assign, `mp validate-claim` won/lost) → build on branch `mp/<slug>/t<id>` from the pinned contract ref (ephemeral bundle outside `docs/masterplan/`) → D6 `verify-scope` + `verify_commands` → PR to `mp-int/<slug>` on pass, release the claim on fail. |

**PR probe (`status` · `next` · `clean` — report-only, never auto-merge).** These three verbs check
for an open PR on the run's branch. Run **shell-side** (the established split — the shell owns git/`gh`,
`bin` is fs-only): resolve `branch` = `state.branch` or, as a fallback, `git -C "<WT>" rev-parse
--abbrev-ref HEAD` (the run branch is checked out in **WT**, §2e¶2 — `-C`-qualified, not bare), then
`gh pr list --head "<branch>" --state open --json number,title,mergeable,url 2>/dev/null` piped to
`mp pr-summary --gh-json='<output>'` → `{hasPr, number, title, url, mergeable}` (`mergeable ∈
yes|no|unknown` — GitHub computes it lazily, so a fresh PR reports `unknown`). `gh` is **best-effort**:
missing / unauthed / no remote / non-GitHub origin → empty → `{hasPr:false}` → no PR line, no error
(it must never break a read-only report). It is **report-only** — masterplan never auto-merges; a merge
happens only via the §2c `branch_finish` gate's Merge path or the user on GitHub. By design this lives
**only** in these human-invoked verbs (+ the §2c gate), **never** in the per-turn `decide` loop — a
"merge your PR" on every resume tick would be the exact over-asking nag the §2d contract kills.

## 3a — Plan lifecycle (serial | parallel — the `planning.mode` gate)

Reached when a bundle is in `phase=plan` with no plan yet: from §3's `full`/`plan` seed path (after
brainstorm's spec is approved and `mp set-phase plan` ran) and from §2's `run_skill resume-phase` op. Selects
between the serial `superpowers:writing-plans` path and the parallel fan-out (§2b) per `planning.mode`.

1. **Resolve the mode.** `serial | parallel | auto`, from the `resume-phase` op's `planning_mode`
   (default `auto`); set at seed via `mp seed --planning-mode=…`. Under host suppression the op
   always carries `serial` (`mp continue` forces it — the plan fan-out needs the Workflow tool,
   which a suppressed host lacks); never route a suppressed host to the parallel branch.
2. **Decompose (unless `serial`).** For `parallel`/`auto`, dispatch `agents/mp-spec-decomposer` against
   `spec.md` → `{ subsystems, recommend_parallel, reason }`.
   - `parallel` → parallel branch (step 4) with this decomposition.
   - `auto` → parallel **iff** `recommend_parallel && subsystems.length ≥ 2`; otherwise serial (step 3).
     Carry the decomposer's `reason` into your narration.
   - `serial` → skip the decomposer → step 3.
3. **Serial path.** Dispatch the `masterplan:mp-planner` agent against the approved `spec.md` → it writes
   both `plan.md` and `plan.index.json` directly (sole producer). Gate it:
   `mp validate-plan-index --plan-index=<plan_index_path>` (on failure, fix and re-parse — never advance
   on an invalid index). Then **`mp load-plan --state=<path> --plan-index=<plan_index_path>`**
   (materializes `state.tasks` from the plan **and** advances `phase→execute` atomically — a bare
   `set-phase execute` would leave `tasks:[]` and the next `decide` would `complete`→archive the bundle)
   + `mp event --state=<path> --type=phase_transition --phase=execute`, `git -C "<MAIN>"` commit the
   bundle (MAIN-resident, §2e¶2), and hand to the resume controller (§2 — `mp continue` returns the
   wave-1 `launch_workflow` op, creating-or-reusing the worktree itself per §2e¶4; the single
   creation home is `mp continue`, never here).
4. **Parallel path.** Hand the decomposition to **§2b**'s plan launch (background fan-out → merge →
   validate → `mp-plan-reviewer` → execute). The phase advances to `execute` inside §2b's completion
   gate, not here.

Both paths converge on the same post-condition — a validated `plan.index.json` + `plan.md`, the
plan's tasks materialized into `state.tasks` and `phase=execute` (both via `mp load-plan`), committed
— after which §2 drives the wave loop.

## 4 — Turn-close (CD-9)

End any turn that needs input with `AskUserQuestion` (2–4 concrete options) — never a free-text
question (sessions compact between turns; a free-text prompt becomes a dead end) and never a silent
stop while a decision is pending. Completion is no longer a silent archive either — the §2c
finalization flow always surfaces the `branch_finish` gate (a risky-action AUQ) before archiving.

**Under `autonomy ∈ {loose, full}`, "needs input" means one of the §2d stop-set gates — nothing else.**
A turn that finished useful work but hit no gate **auto-progresses**: do the obvious next safe step in
the same turn (record → commit → dispatch the next wave) and close **without** an AUQ, ending the
text with the `<mp-autoprogress>` marker (§2d) so the global guard stands down. Do **not** manufacture a
"what next?" / "run codex?" / "Ready for Wave N" question — that over-asking is exactly what §2d forbids.
Reserve the AUQ for the genuine stop-set.

Otherwise close cleanly. What's gone from v7 is the *hook-driven per-turn* ceremony — trace
markers, breadcrumbs, and summary-block signals fired on every turn by Stop-hook machinery. v8
consolidates these into a single prompt-driven close: the **CC-3-trampoline** sequence defined in-file
at §2d "Turn-close routing", which emits the summary block + exit breadcrumb **once, at turn-close**,
then closes with this AUQ at a stop-set gate. (The §0 version banner is an *invocation*-time
obligation — first, before anything — not part of turn-close.) That sequence is the only ceremony
that survives.

## 6.5 — Multi-repo apply (qctl backend) — flag-off spec, relocated

The qctl GPU-worker implementer backend's multi-repo apply/verify/commit procedure is a **spec for a
feature that is OFF** (`state.implementer.qctl.enabled` — nothing sets it yet). The full sequence
lives in `docs/design/qctl-multi-repo-apply.md`; do not execute any of it unless that flag is true.
