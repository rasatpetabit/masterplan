# /masterplan — thin resumable shell (v8)

> v8 clean-core. The DECISIONS live in `lib/*.mjs` behind `bin/masterplan.mjs` (deterministic,
> zero-LLM-token, unit-tested) — this shell only **sequences**. Durable state lives in
> `docs/masterplan/<slug>/` (`state.yml` is the source of truth). CD-7: the shell is the SOLE
> state writer, via `bin` — **never** hand-edit, `Write`, or `Edit` `state.yml` or `events.jsonl`;
> every mutation goes through an `mp` subcommand (`seed`, `set-phase`, `set-status`, `mark-task`,
> `load-plan`, `open-gate`, `clear-gate`, `event`, …). A raw `Write`/`Edit` both violates CD-7 **and** floods the screen with the file diff
> (anti-flood) — `mp` writes the file server-side and returns one terse JSON line. Work goes to
> dedicated agents (`agents/*.md`), the L2 Workflow engine (`workflows/execute.workflow.js`), and
> `superpowers` skills — never run substantive work inline in this context (it holds sequencing state only).

Throughout, **`mp`** denotes `node "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/bin/masterplan.mjs"`. Every decision and
every state write goes through it. **The v9 seam:** `mp` runs the LOCAL git its transactions need
(`record-result`'s split commit, `continue`'s worktree create + recovery reset, `sweep`'s removals —
always `-C`-qualified to loci it derives itself); **network git (`push`, `gh`), every commit outside
those transactions, and all dispatch stay this shell's job.** Results print as JSON on stdout; on a
non-zero exit, read stderr and act on it. **Every run executes in a per-run linked worktree (code) with its
bundle in the MAIN checkout (state); every shell `git` is therefore `-C`-qualified by locus — see the
worktree locus model in §2e (bare `git` is forbidden in this shell).**

## 0 — Boot (every invocation, unconditional)

1. **Version banner — FIRST, before anything else**, even on a compaction-resume / `invoked_skills`
   re-injection (it is the lone CC-2 survivor; build NO enforcement/telemetry apparatus around it):
   run `mp version --args="<verbatim $ARGUMENTS, or empty>" --cwd="<repo root or pwd>"` and print the
   single line it returns.
2. **Host detect.** Run `mp detect-host` with the signals you can observe (`--agent-is-codex` if the
   session identifies the agent as Codex, `--native-tools` if Codex-native tools like `apply_patch`/
   `update_plan` are exposed, `--agents-md` if an `AGENTS.md` is present). If the result's
   `isCodex` is true, the host lacks Claude Code's Workflow tool: this is the
   **`codex_host_suppressed`** condition the downstream paths check — it gates the Claude-Code-only
   native task tools in the §2 `probe` ops (liveness/reap recovery) and supplies
   `mp continue --codex-suppressed` (the foreground-sequential wave path). Persisted
   `codex.routing`/`codex.review` are unaffected.

## 1 — Parse the verb

Reserved verbs: `full, brainstorm, plan, execute, finish, retro, import, doctor, status, validate,
stats, clean, next, verbs, render, publish, follow`. Precedence:

0. **No args** → the **resume controller** (§2).
1. First token is a reserved verb → that verb; consume it, the rest are its args.
2. First arg starts with `--` → `--resume=<path>` / `--resume <path>` alias `execute <path>`;
   other `--flags` are config overrides.
3. Otherwise → treat the whole arg string as a **brainstorm topic** (catch-all).

A topic literally named after a reserved verb needs a word in front (`/masterplan add plan timer`).

## 2 — Resume controller (bare entry, `execute`, and after every durable transition)

The spine, now a TRAMPOLINE: locate the bundle, call `mp continue`, and execute the ONE typed op it
returns — re-invoking until an op closes the turn. `mp continue` internalizes what used to be prose
here: Guard D acquire + confirm (every entry; the per-entry re-acquire IS the open-turn heartbeat,
§2e¶8), migrate-on-load (with a `<state>.v<N>.bak` backup), wave backfill from `plan.index.json`,
worktree create-or-reuse (§2e¶4), the crash-recovery scope reset, the phase-1 `active_run` marker
(frozen F-SCOPE `scope` + D6 `baseline`), per-task routing (`routeTask`), and the inline
`finalize_run` reconcile (the same `mp record-result --reconcile` transaction). It runs the LOCAL git
those steps need itself (`-C`-qualified to loci it derives); the shell keeps Workflow/Agent/skill
dispatch, every `AskUserQuestion`, and ALL network ops (`git push`, `gh`, agent-dispatch review).

1. **Derive MAIN, then locate the bundle.** **MAIN must be derived FIRST** (§2e¶1:
   `MAIN="$(dirname "$(git rev-parse --path-format=absolute --git-common-dir)")"` — the sole
   sanctioned bare git) — the discovery glob and every bundle path depend on it, and cwd may already
   be a linked worktree. Then: `execute <path>` → that `state.yml`. Else discover
   `<MAIN>/docs/masterplan/*/state.yml` (absolute-MAIN, §2e¶1) whose status is not archived: exactly
   one → use it; several → an `AskUserQuestion` picker; none → there is no active run (route by
   verb, or offer to start one).
2. **Session sweep — first §2 entry per session, MAIN-only (§2e¶5).** `mp sweep --repo-root="<MAIN>"
   --apply` — classification AND execution live in the subcommand (dry-run is its bare default; the
   session sweep applies per the Q2 contract: auto repair/prune/remove/normalize, trust the
   classifier's proof-gate). `manual` entries return in `skipped` — surface them as WARNs, take NO
   automated action. Skip the sweep on later §2 entries this session.
3. **Catch a completion first.** If a Workflow completion notification re-invoked you and its
   `<result>{…}</result>` (run/task matching `active_run`) is in front of you → do NOT call
   `continue` yet: run the **completion protocol — §2a for an execute wave, §2b for a planning run**
   (branch on `active_run.kind`). Recording BEFORE `continue` is load-bearing — a finished run whose
   tasks are still `pending` on disk looks like a crash (→ a re-dispatch of a wave you already hold
   results for). Then fall through to step 4.
4. **The loop.** `mp continue --state=<MAIN>/docs/masterplan/<slug>/state.yml [--alive|--dead]
   [--stale-reconciled] [--force] [--codex-suppressed]` → ONE op JSON. Execute it per the table;
   `probe` ops re-invoke `continue` with the answer, everything else ends the loop. Pass
   `--codex-suppressed` when §0 host-detect reported a Codex host (`isCodex`). A non-zero exit is a loud
   invariant — read stderr (e.g. `phase is 'execute' but tasks is empty` → the plan was never
   loaded: `mp seed-tasks --state=<path> --plan-index=<path>`, then re-enter).

   | op | do |
   |---|---|
   | `launch_workflow` | `cd "<op.cwd>"` FIRST — the write-only cwd signal the about-to-launch agents inherit (§2e¶3); never read cwd back. Launch `workflows/<op.workflow>.workflow.js` in the BACKGROUND via the Workflow tool with `args = op.args` (`workflow:'plan'` carries no args — supply `{ subsystems, specPath, repoRoot }` from §3a/§2b, re-dispatching `mp-spec-decomposer` first if the decomposition isn't in hand). Then `mp promote-active-run --state=<path> --run-id=<id> --task-id=<id>` (the op's `next`) and close to await the completion notification. Do NOT mark tasks or commit here — the engine has them in flight. |
   | `dispatch_foreground` | The `--codex-suppressed` wave path (Residual 3B — a suppressed host has no Workflow tool). `cd "<op.cwd>"` FIRST (same §2e¶3 signal), then run `op.tasks` **sequentially in this session** — Codex: implement each task inline, tracking via `update_plan`; Claude Code fallback: one `masterplan:mp-implementer` Agent per task, awaited one at a time, brief = the task's payload (same shape the workflow dispatches). Honor each task's `files` scope. Assemble the standard result `{wave: op.wave, baseline: op.baseline, tasks: [{task_id, digest:{task_id, status:'done'\|'failed'\|'qctl', summary, files_changed, blockers}}]}`, write it to a scratch file OUTSIDE the bundle dir, then `mp record-result --state=<path> --result-file=<scratch>` and act per §2a step 2. NO promote, NO probe — there is no background task; a crash mid-wave re-emits this op on the next `continue` (agents never commit, so re-running is idempotent). |
   | `probe` `kind:'alive'` | `TaskGet(op.task_id)`: still running → re-invoke `continue --alive` (→ `stop wait`); finished/absent with no result in hand (compaction dropped the notification) → `continue --dead` (recovery is idempotent — agents never commit). |
   | `probe` `kind:'reap'` | A dead session's backgrounded Workflow MAY still be running: `TaskList` → `TaskStop` any surviving run for `op.task_id` (**Claude Code only** — no-op when `codex_host_suppressed`, where native task tools are absent), then re-invoke `continue --dead --stale-reconciled` — `continue` then resets the wave scope in WT and re-launches. |
   | `ask` `ask:'gate'` | Re-render the durable gate's `AskUserQuestion` (CD-9). **Finalization gates** (`verification_failed` / `no_verification_command` / `docs_normalize` / `branch_finish`): re-render via `mp finish-step --state=<path>` — its `ask:'gate'` op carries the full payload (incl. the rehydrated codex digest for `branch_finish`) — and act per the **§2c** answer flags (the clear-gate + bundle commit run inside the subcommand). Other gates: named option → act, `mp clear-gate`, `git -C "<MAIN>"` commit the bundle, re-enter the loop. Free-text / no clear answer → keep the gate, respond, close. NEVER auto-proceed regardless of autonomy (the durable marker outranks a native AUQ that can't survive compaction). |
   | `ask` `ask:'owner-blocked'` \| `'owner-lost'` | Guard D (§2e¶8): another live session owns — or mid-turn took over — this bundle; NOTHING was written. AUQ with the incumbent's `host`/`session`: **Take over (force)** → re-invoke `continue --force` · **Abort** → close without touching the bundle · **Read-only** → answer/inspect, NO mutations or dispatches. NEVER auto-force regardless of autonomy. |
   | `ask` `ask:'legacy-refused'` | Pre-5.0 / unparseable legacy (the deliberate R3 refusal; `op.backup` holds the untouched original). Do NOT raw-rewrite `state.yml` (CD-7) — `mp seed` a FRESH bundle (re-deriving tasks via §3), finish the run under masterplan v7, or stop and ask. |
   | `ask` `ask:'waves-unbackfillable'` | Tasks carry `wave:null` and `plan.index.json` is missing/insufficient. Re-derive the index (re-parse `plan.md` via the `masterplan:mp-planner` agent), then re-enter the loop — `continue` backfills durably itself. |
   | `ask` `ask:'dispatch-error'` \| `'decide-error'` | A loud invariant fired (plan/state file-set drift, missing plan.index entry, decide-loop exhaustion). Surface `op.error` via AUQ — never paper over a thrown invariant. |
   | `run_skill` `skill:'resume-phase'` | Mid-`{brainstorm\|plan}` with no plan built (`tasks:[]`). **Do NOT finalize/archive.** `phase==plan` → the plan lifecycle (**§3a**) with `op.planning_mode`. `phase==brainstorm` → re-entering a live brainstorm stays deferred: AUQ continue / restart / stop. |
   | `run_skill` `skill:'finish'` | All execute tasks done → the **finalization flow (§2c)**: drive `mp finish-step` one op per call — verify-before-completion (cite output) → `retro.md` → durable `branch_finish` gate → archive **LAST**. NEVER a silent archive. |
   | `stop` `reason:'wait'` | A live run owns the wave. Report it and close — its completion notification re-invokes this controller (→ step 3). |
   | `stop` (coordination) | `publish_needed` / `coordinate` → the §7 coordination playbook, with the op's facts. |

5. **CD-7 commit discipline.** Each durable change = an `mp` write (atomic) FOLLOWED BY a `git
   commit` — **bundle** commits `git -C "<MAIN>"`, **code** commits `git -C "<WT>"` (the split
   commit, §2e¶6) — never one mixed `commit -am`. On the wave path BOTH sides run inside
   `mp record-result`; `mp continue` writes state (markers, backfill, worktree record) but never
   commits — its writes are swept into the next state commit, and a crash between write and commit
   is safe (`state.yml` leads, resume re-commits). Wave members (agents / the L2 engine) return
   digests only; they NEVER write `state.yml` or commit, which is exactly what makes re-dispatch
   idempotent.

## 2a — Wave completion protocol (the L1↔L2 seam)

`workflows/execute.workflow.js` (L2) runs **exactly one wave per launch**; the LAUNCH half now lives
inside `mp continue` (§2): it resolves routing (`routeTask`) + the frozen F-SCOPE `scope`, captures
the D6 baseline, ensures the worktree (create-or-reuse, §2e¶4), writes the phase-1 marker, and
returns the `launch_workflow` op the shell executes (`cd "<WT>"` → background Workflow → promote →
close). A Workflow script has no module/fs/git access — the op threads data in via `args`; the
workflow itself only dispatches agents and echoes the baseline. This section is the RESULT half:
what to do when the engine's completion notification re-invokes the controller (§2 step 3).

**Completion** (re-invoked holding the engine's `<result>` — reached from §2 step 3):

The whole record transaction is ONE subcommand — heartbeat → mark digests → D6 verify-scope →
out-of-scope revert → split commit (code→WT, state→MAIN) → marker clear (iff the whole wave is done)
→ the `next` advisory — implemented in `lib/wave-commit.mjs`, crash-safe at every prefix (any crash resumes
via `mp continue`'s inline `finalize_run` reconcile — the same transaction, `--reconcile` mode):

1. **Record.** Write the engine's whole `<result>` JSON to a scratch file OUTSIDE the bundle dir
   (e.g. `/tmp/mp-result-<slug>.json` — a bundle-dir scratch would be swept into the state commit),
   then `mp record-result --state=<path> --result-file=<that file>`.
2. **Act on the returned JSON.**
   - `outcome:'lost-to-other'` → NOTHING was written; a second session took this bundle over while
     our wave ran. **STOP** — surface the takeover via `AskUserQuestion` (reclaim via
     `mp acquire-owner --force`, or abandon this session's recording) (Guard D, §2e¶8).
   - `failed[]` / `qctl[]` / `blocking_reviews[]` non-empty → surface via `AskUserQuestion` (§4) —
     never silently loop. Failed/blocked tasks stay `pending` with the marker intact; `next` is
     `recover_and_redispatch` for ONLY those. `qctl` tasks hand to §6.
   - `scope.ok:false` → the offenders were already reverted in WT (`reverted[]`); surface the
     breach. In-scope work stands.
   - Otherwise **narrate tersely** — at most a 1–2 line wave summary (what completed / what's
     next), NEVER the `state.yml` or `WORKLOG.md` diff (anti-flood) — and **re-enter the §2 loop**
     (step 4): `mp continue` derives the next op itself (the next wave's `launch_workflow`, or
     `run_skill finish`). On a goals-enabled bundle, fold a **one-line goals reminder** into that terse summary — the run's frozen goals (from `goals.md`) are the finish-time bar (§2c `run_goal_check`), so surfacing them each wave keeps them from being forgotten mid-run.

## 2b — Parallel-plan dispatch + completion (the planning L1↔L2 seam)

`workflows/plan.workflow.js` (L2) fans out **one `mp-subsystem-planner` per subsystem** in a single
parallel barrier and returns **fragments only** — it never writes artifacts or commits. This shell
owns the decomposition (the subsystem list), the deterministic merge, and the gate. It mirrors §2a
**minus the wave loop and minus any scope capture** — the drafters are read-only, so there is no D6
baseline and no `verify-scope`. `active_run.kind:'plan'` carries **no wave**.

**Launch** (reached from §3a's parallel branch, and from crash recovery):

1. **Subsystems in hand.** Use the decomposition from §3a (`mp-spec-decomposer`'s `{subsystems}`). On
   a recovery re-entry with none in hand, re-dispatch `mp-spec-decomposer` first — the fan-out is
   idempotent, so re-deriving the seam map is safe.
2. **Phase-1 plan marker.** `mp set-active-run --state=<path> --kind=plan` — a planning marker (no
   wave) written BEFORE launch so a crash in the launch gap resumes as recovery, not a blind
   re-dispatch.
3. **Re-enter the §2 loop.** `mp continue` now returns the `launch_workflow workflow:'plan'` op —
   per the §2 table: launch `workflows/plan.workflow.js` in the background with
   `args = { subsystems:<step 1>, specPath:<spec_path>, repoRoot:<repo> }`, promote the handles
   (`mp promote-active-run --run-id=<id> --task-id=<id>`), close to await the completion
   notification (→ §2 step 3 → here). Do NOT merge or commit here — the fan-out is in flight.

**Completion** (re-invoked holding the engine's `<result>` = `{ subsystems:[…fragments…], specPath,
repoRoot }`, reached from §2 step 3 when `active_run.kind==='plan'`):

1. **Reconcile coverage.** Diff the returned fragment `key`s against the requested subsystem keys;
   **surface any missing subsystem** (a drafter that errored/skipped nulls out — never fake it). A
   missing drafter is a `REVISE`-class gate, not a silent drop.
2. **Stage the fragments.** Write the returned `subsystems` array to
   `<MAIN>/docs/masterplan/<slug>/.plan-fragments.json` (absolute-MAIN, §2e¶1 — the bundle lives in
   MAIN even when cwd is a worktree; a plain `Write` — `plan.index.json` / `plan.md` / fragments are
   **ARTIFACTS, not CD-7 state**, so this write is allowed outside the `mp`-only rule).
3. **Merge (deterministic).** `mp merge-plan-fragments --fragments=<MAIN>/docs/masterplan/<slug>/.plan-fragments.json
   --out=<plan_index_path> --plan-md=<plan_path> --meta='{"title":"<topic>","spec":"<spec_path>"}'` —
   assigns global ids/waves, normalises `codex`, **validates BEFORE writing**, and stamps
   `plan_hash`/`generated_at` onto both artifacts. A merge error (dup key, dangling/cyclic dep, invalid
   index) exits non-zero and writes nothing — surface it and stop.
4. **Explicit gate.** `mp validate-plan-index --plan-index=<plan_index_path>` — the standalone strict
   check, the compensating layer now that fragments crossed a background-Workflow boundary (the
   `FRAGMENT` tool-schema enum guarded the foreground path; this re-guards `codex` shape + same-wave
   file-disjointness on disk).
5. **Review.** Dispatch `agents/mp-plan-reviewer` against `plan.md` / `plan.index.json` / `spec.md`
   → `PASS | REVISE | FAIL`.
   - **PASS** → `mp clear-active-run`; satisfy the **plan gate** first (§3b — `mp load-plan` exits 3 with a
     `run_gate_review` op until the cross-vendor pass is recorded via `mp record-gate-review --gate=plan`); then **`mp load-plan --state=<path> --plan-index=<plan_index_path>`**
     (materializes `state.tasks` from the plan **and** advances `phase→execute` in one atomic write — the
     plan→execute seam; a bare `set-phase execute` would leave `tasks:[]`, so the next `decide` would
     `complete`→archive the just-planned bundle) + `mp event --state=<path> --type=phase_transition
     --phase=execute`; `git -C "<MAIN>"` commit `plan.index.json` + `plan.md` + `state.yml` together
     (all bundle artifacts, MAIN-resident, §2e¶2; terse 1–2 line narration, never the diff — anti-flood);
     then re-enter the §2 loop (step 4 — `mp continue` returns the wave-1 `launch_workflow` op,
     creating-or-reusing the worktree itself, §2e¶4).
   - **REVISE / FAIL** (or a missing subsystem from step 1) → `mp clear-active-run`; surface the
     reviewer's findings via `AskUserQuestion` (§4) — revise-and-replan / accept-as-is (REVISE only) /
     stop — and keep `phase=plan`. Never auto-advance past a non-PASS verdict.

## 2c — Finalization flow (the `complete` action + the `finish` verb — `mp finish-step`)

`complete` is no longer a silent archive — it is the umbrella **finish** flow: verify the work (and
cite it), write the retro, then surface a **durable** `branch_finish` gate before archiving. The
state machine lives in **`mp finish-step`** (`lib/finish-step.mjs`) — a re-entrant trampoline, the §2
pattern: the shell calls it, executes the ONE op returned, and re-calls with the answer threaded back
as flags. Every durable transaction — verified-SHA record, gate open/clear, the codex events, merge +
worktree teardown + disposition, archive + owner release, and the bundle commits bracketing them —
runs INSIDE the subcommand; the shell keeps only the genuinely-LLM/network work: running verification
(skill), writing the retro, running the agent-dispatch adversary review, the PR probe, the push, and the AUQs.
**Archive is LAST** and reachable only through a retired disposition — archiving earlier strands the
run (the §2-step-1 discover filter hides archived bundles, so the gate could never re-surface; the
one thing v7's flow got wrong).

**Loop:** `mp finish-step --state=<MAIN>/docs/masterplan/<slug>/state.yml [answer flags]`. It
handles with NO prose steps: Guard D
acquire/heartbeat (`owner-blocked`/`owner-lost` mirror §2's rows), the retired-disposition re-entry
shortcut (MAIN-side, NO WT git — the teardown removes `<WT>` before archive, so a WT snapshot there
would die; the Codex P1), the WT snapshot, the task-scope dirty-commit (unrelated dirt untouched —
protect-user-work; committing moves HEAD, so the verified check re-keys automatically), the
candidates-gated `docs_normalize` offer (durable `docs_normalize`/`docs_normalize_skipped` event
guard — once per run, zero candidates → silent), the verified-at-SHA skip, retro write-if-absent gating, the durable sha-keyed adversary-review re-entry guard
(`adversary_review` / `adversary_review_skipped` events), the `branch_finish` gate open + resolution
transaction, and archive + release-owner. A compaction at ANY point resumes cleanly: re-invoke with no
answer flags and the same op (or the open gate) comes back.

| op | do (then re-invoke `mp finish-step` with the answer flag) |
|---|---|
| `run_verify` `{commands, head, wt}` | `superpowers:verification-before-completion`: RUN fresh, **cite real output + exit code** (CD-3; "should pass" is not evidence). Command source: `op.commands` (the union of the plan tasks' `verify_commands`); if empty, the skill's own IDENTIFY; if STILL none under `--autonomy=full`, `mp open-gate --id=no_verification_command` + AUQ (specify one / proceed without) — never silently skip. PASS → re-invoke with `--verify-passed` (records the SHA durably; a re-entry at unchanged HEAD skips the re-run). FAIL → `--verify-failed` (opens the durable `verification_failed` gate; the returned `ask` is the turn-close). |
| `run_goal_check` `{goals_path, base, head, wt}` | Fires only on a goals-enabled bundle, AFTER verify passes and BEFORE the retro. Dispatch `agents/mp-goal-assessor` against `op.goals_path` + the branch diff (`op.base..op.head`) → a per-goal met/unmet verdict with evidence. Then record the verdict durably: `mp record-goal-check --state=<MAIN>/docs/masterplan/<slug>/state.yml --assessment-file=<scratch outside the bundle dir>`. All goals met → re-invoke `mp finish-step` with `--goals-met` (records the SHA-keyed pass; a re-entry at unchanged HEAD skips the re-assessment). Any goal unmet → `--goals-unmet` (opens the durable `goals_unmet` gate; the returned `ask` is the turn-close). **Fail-closed on dispatch failure:** if the assessor dispatch itself errors / the lane is unreachable, do NOT silently pass — re-invoke with `--goals-unmet --manual-verdict` and drive the gate in **manual-verdict mode** (the operator supplies the met/unmet call at the gate AUQ rather than the assessor). |
| `write_retro` `{path, retro_only?}` | Generate `retro.md` at `op.path` (write-if-absent — finish-step re-checks the fs, so a re-entry skips it). Then re-invoke with no new flags. Subsumes the old `retro` verb. |
| `run_adversary_review` `{base, head, wt, digest_path}` | The whole-branch cross-vendor adversary review — network, stays shell-side. Route it through the agent-dispatch control plane's adversary lane (NO model is named — `--class adversary` resolves to a cross-vendor reviewer engine-side), run foreground from WT: `( cd "<op.wt>" && agent-dispatch review --class adversary --base <op.base> )`. **Fail-soft, never wedge finish:** ANY non-success — non-zero exit, `agent-dispatch` missing from PATH, empty output — → `--review-skipped --review-reason="<tight reason>"`; finish-step writes the sha-keyed skip event whose hyphenated "adversary-review … skipped" summary deliberately does NOT match the audit's `\b(codex\|adversary)\s+review\b`, so a degraded finish still trips `adversary_review_configured_but_zero_invocations` — correct. On **exit 0**: `Write` a brief digest (count + top findings, not the raw dump) to `op.digest_path` (absolute-MAIN, §2e¶1; the Write tool is not shell-evaluated, so arbitrary review bytes are safe — never interpolate the digest into a shell word), then `--review-done --review-count=<n> --review-base=<op.base> --review-digest-file=<op.digest_path>` — finish-step emits the durable `adversary_review` event (its `summary` is the audit signal that DOES match `\b(codex\|adversary)\s+review\b`; `data.sha/base/count` are the quote-safe machine scalars the re-entry guard keys on; `note` carries the digest verbatim for gate rehydration). Residual window: a death between the reviewer's exit 0 and the re-invoke leaves no record at HEAD, so resume re-runs the review — harmless and idempotent at an unchanged tree. |
| `ask` `ask:'gate'` `gate:'branch_finish'` `{head, branch, base, dispositions, review}` | First **probe for an open PR** (the §3 probe: `gh pr list --head "<op.branch>" … \| mp pr-summary`). AUQ labelled with `op.base`: `Merge to <base> locally (Recommended)` · `Push and open a PR` · `Keep branch + worktree as-is` · `Discard everything` (typed "discard" required). If the probe found a PR (`hasPr`), relabel the second option → `View / merge open PR #<n> (mergeable: <yes\|no\|unknown>)` — same `pr` choice; its resolution is a no-op push surfacing the existing PR's URL, never a second one. Fold `op.review` (`{present, digest, count, base}`, rehydrated from the durable event — the live in-context digest does not survive compaction, the event does) into the AUQ when present. This AUQ is the turn-close. Resolution = re-invoke with `--choice=<merge\|pr\|keep\|discard>` (add `--removal-force` only for an intended-dirty teardown): finish-step runs the disposition transaction (§2e¶7) and archives — except `pr`, which first returns the `shell push_pr` op (two-phase: archive happens only after `--choice=pr --pushed`). A free-text / "not ready" answer holds the gate and chats (§2 `ask:'gate'` rule) — the "not done yet" escape, nothing archives. |
| `ask` `ask:'gate'` `gate:'docs_normalize'` `{candidates, base, head, wt}` | The finish-time docs-normalization offer — fires once per run, only when `op.candidates` (the `*.md` the run's branch created/modified vs `op.base`, run-bundle dir excluded) is non-empty; a bare re-entry recomputes the list. AUQ: `Normalize docs into the repo's structure (Recommended)` · `Keep as-is`. **Normalize** → in `<op.wt>`: fold each candidate into the repo's existing category-organized docs (match the surrounding structure and conventions); strip plan provenance — slugs, wave/task numbers, "implemented by plan X" phrasing, date-stamped design filenames; delete plan-specific files that empty out; `git -C "<op.wt>" add` exactly the touched files + commit, then re-invoke with `--docs-normalized --docs-count=<n>`. Two-phase like `push_pr`: NOTHING durable changes until the flag arrives — a death mid-edit re-renders the gate, never silently skips — and the commit moves HEAD **before** verification, so the suite runs once over the FINAL tree (the adversary review covers the normalized docs too). **Keep as-is** → `--docs-skipped --docs-reason="<tight reason>"` — the durable skip event; the offer never re-fires this run (leftovers stay visible repo-wide via the doctor's `plan-doc-cruft` WARN). A free-text answer holds the gate (§2 `ask:'gate'` rule). `state.docs.normalize: off` suppresses the offer entirely. |
| `ask` `ask:'gate'` `gate:'verification_failed'` (and `no_verification_command`, shell-opened above) | AUQ: *Fix first & re-run* → `mp clear-gate`, close (fix code + commit, then resume → verification re-runs fresh and re-opens the gate if still red). *Proceed anyway (reviewed)* → `--verify-passed` — the reviewed override records the SHA AND clears the gate, so a re-entry doesn't re-loop the same failure. *Abort finish* → `mp clear-gate`, close (the run stays resumable; nothing archived). For `no_verification_command`: *Specify a command* → RUN it fresh, **cite output** (CD-3) → PASS = `--verify-passed`, FAIL = `--verify-failed`; *Proceed without* = `--verify-passed` (the reviewed "no verification available" override). Never silently skip verification or archive. |
| `ask` `ask:'gate'` `gate:'goals_unmet'` `{unmet, assessment, base, head, wt, manual?}` | The durable goals gate — the run's frozen goals were not all met by the delivered work. Surface `op.unmet` (the unmet goals + the assessor's evidence, or, in `manual` mode, the goals awaiting the operator's own verdict) via AUQ: **Fix & continue** → `mp clear-gate`, close (fix code + commit, then resume → the goal check re-runs fresh over the new HEAD and re-opens the gate if still unmet) · **Accept waiver** → `--goals-waived --waiver-reason="<tight reason>"` (the reviewed override — records the SHA AND clears the gate so a re-entry doesn't re-loop, and appends the durable waiver event) · **Abort finish** → `mp clear-gate`, close (the run stays resumable; nothing archived). In `manual` mode the same AUQ additionally carries the met/unmet verdict itself. A free-text / "not ready" answer holds the gate and chats (§2 `ask:'gate'` rule). NEVER auto-waive regardless of autonomy. |
| `ask` `ask:'owner-blocked'` \| `'owner-lost'` | Guard D (§2e¶8) — same acts as the §2 rows: take over (`--force`) / abort / read-only. NEVER auto-force regardless of autonomy. |
| `ask` `ask:'dispatch-error'` | A loud invariant: WT missing without a retired disposition (reconcile via `mp sweep`); merge target mismatch (MAIN has a non-base branch checked out — switch MAIN to the base and re-issue `--choice=merge`; finish-step never checks out the user's MAIN itself); merge conflict (already aborted — MAIN left clean, the gate stays open); worktree removal failed (disposition stays `active`, reaped by the next sweep — or re-run with `--removal-force`). Surface `op.error` via AUQ — never paper over. |
| `shell` `{kind:'push_pr', branch, base, wt}` | The network half of the `pr` choice — phase 1 of a two-phase handshake: NOTHING durable has changed yet (gate still open, disposition still `active`), so a death here re-renders `branch_finish` instead of silently archiving with no PR. Run `git -C "<op.wt>" push -u origin <op.branch>` then `gh pr create --base <op.base> …` — or, when the probe found an open PR, the push is a fast-forward no-op and no second PR is opened; surface the existing URL. On success re-invoke with `--choice=pr --pushed` — phase 2 retires (`kept_by_user`), clears the gate, and archives. On push/PR failure just re-invoke bare: the gate re-renders and the AUQ surfaces the error. |
| `stop` `reason:'archived'` | Done — owner lock released, the §2 discover filter now hides the bundle, the run goes quiet. Narrate 1–2 lines. |
| `stop` `reason:'retro_done'` | The `--retro-only` terminal: retro exists; nothing archived, no gates. |

**Manual entry — `/masterplan finish`.** Bare `finish` locates the bundle and `mp decide`s: `complete`
→ drive this loop; tasks still pending (or a run live) → AUQ "N task(s) pending — finalize anyway?
(→ §2c) / keep working (→ §2) / just re-write the retro (→ `--retro-only`)" — never silent-archive an
incomplete run. `finish --retro-only` passes `--retro-only` (retro write-if-absent → `retro_done`; the
old `retro` behavior — never archives, never gates).

## 2d — Autonomy contract (loose / full — when a turn may auto-progress)

`state.autonomy` governs exactly ONE thing: whether a turn that finished useful work but hit **no
gate** may close **silently** (auto-progress) or must end with an `AskUserQuestion`. It does **not**
widen, narrow, or skip any gate — the gate set is identical at every autonomy level (`decide` doesn't
read `autonomy`; it only ever returns real actions). Under `autonomy ∈ {loose, full}` the orchestrator
**auto-progresses** and does NOT manufacture an end-of-turn question.

**The COMPLETE stop-set** — the *only* things that may end a turn with an AUQ under loose/full; if the
turn hit none of these, it MUST auto-progress, not ask:

- The §2 `ask:'gate'` op for any durable gate: `branch_finish`, `verification_failed`, `no_verification_command`, `docs_normalize`, `goals_unmet`.
- A spec/plan **review FAIL** or a missing-subsystem REVISE (§2b step 5 / §3a).
- A wave that surfaced a **failure** — a `failed`/`blocked` task or a `blocking` review verdict (§2a
  completion) — or **blocker re-engagement** after the CD-4 ladder fails its rungs.
- Re-entering an **in-progress brainstorm** (`run_skill resume-phase`, `phase==brainstorm`): continue / restart / stop.
- The §2-step-1 **multi-bundle discover picker**, and the bare-`finish` **pending-tasks** prompt
  (finalize anyway / keep working / `--retro-only`, §2c manual entry) — both genuine "which path?" forks.
- An explicit **risky-action** confirmation: push / merge / discard / force / external message / secrets.

**Explicitly forbidden** orchestrator-added asks (these ARE the over-asking the contract kills — never
emit them under loose/full):

<!-- cd9-exempt: this list QUOTES forbidden asks as anti-pattern examples to ban them; it does not emit them. -->

- "Run codex or not?" — routing is decided inside `mp continue` (`routeTask`), never by asking.
- "What should I do next?" / "dispatch the next wave?" — between successful steps you **auto-proceed**:
  `mp record-result` → dispatch the next wave **in the same turn** (§2a completion → execute `next`). A non-gate
  `recover_and_redispatch`, `launch_workflow`, or no-Workflow `dispatch_foreground` op is an
  instruction to act, not a reportable stopping state. If the host cannot launch Claude Code Workflow handles,
  invoke `mp continue --no-workflow` (alias of the foreground path) rather than leaving a phase-1
  `{wave, phase:'launching'}` marker stranded for the user.
- Per-small-task "looks good?" / "shall I continue?" confirmations.
- "Ready for Wave N" / "awaiting completion" / "status this turn:" ceremonial closers.

**Carve-out marker.** On an **auto-progress turn** — work done, the §2 loop returned a non-gate op
(`launch_workflow` / `probe` / `stop wait` / a committed + reconciled wave) and you are closing
**without** an AUQ — end the turn's text with the literal token
**`<mp-autoprogress>`**. The global Stop guard
(`~/.claude/hooks/auq-guard.sh`) stands down when it sees this marker, so it won't force a ceremonial
AUQ onto an authorized autonomous turn. **Never** emit it on a turn that surfaces a stop-set gate (the
gate's own AUQ is the turn-close) or when `autonomy` is neither loose nor full. It is a stand-down
signal for *this plugin's* authorized auto-progress, mirroring the user-side `<no-auq>` hatch.

**Turn-close routing (CC-3-trampoline).** Every turn-close in this shell — a stop-set gate's AUQ, an
auto-progress `<mp-autoprogress>` close, or a plain stop — runs the same canonical **CC-3-trampoline**
sequence, defined **here**: emit the turn's summary block + exit breadcrumb **exactly once**, at
turn-close (never per-tool-call — the v7 hook-driven per-turn ceremony is gone, §5), then close with
the right terminator — an `AskUserQuestion` at a stop-set gate (CD-9), or the `<mp-autoprogress>`
marker on an authorized auto-progress (above). The §0 version banner is an *invocation*-time
obligation (first, before anything), **not** part of this turn-close sequence. This router is the
single in-file enforcement point — no phase-file indirection.

## 2e — Worktree locus model (bundle-in-MAIN, code-in-WT — create / sweep / commit / teardown)

Every v8 run executes in a **per-run linked worktree holding code only**; its run bundle stays in the
MAIN checkout. This section DEFINES the two loci, the split commit, and the teardown — and points at
where create (¶4), sweep (¶5), and teardown (¶7) now execute. The compute core is `lib/worktree.mjs`;
create-or-reuse runs inside `mp continue`, the sweep inside `mp sweep`, and the teardown inside
`mp finish-step` (local git in `mp` — the v9 seam).

1. **Two loci, one object store.**
   - **MAIN** = the primary worktree (repo root). Re-derive every turn, cwd-independent:
     `MAIN="$(dirname "$(git rev-parse --path-format=absolute --git-common-dir)")"` (resolves to the
     MAIN repo root from ANY cwd inside it, incl. a linked worktree). The **run bundle**
     `docs/masterplan/<slug>/` ALWAYS lives here, on `base` — never on the run branch. So **every
     bundle path is absolute-MAIN, always, in every section** (edited or not): `--state`,
     `--plan-index`, `--plan-md`, `.plan-fragments.json`, `adversary-review-digest.txt`, `retro.md`,
     `--note-file`, and every `mp event/mark-task/open-gate/load-plan/...` target is
     `<MAIN>/docs/masterplan/<slug>/…`.
   - **WT** = `<MAIN>/.worktrees/<slug>`, the per-run **code** worktree on branch `masterplan/<slug>`.
     Holds CODE ONLY — the branch never commits the bundle dir, so `merge masterplan/<slug> → base` at
     finish is conflict-free (base's already-advanced bundle wins; no re-point).
   - Derivations (deterministic, mirror `lib/worktree.mjs`): `WT=<MAIN>/.worktrees/<slug>`;
     `branch=masterplan/<slug>`; `branchExists` ⇔ `git -C "<MAIN>" rev-parse --verify --quiet
     refs/heads/masterplan/<slug>` exits 0.

2. **Every shell git is `-C`-qualified by locus — bare `git` is forbidden in this shell.** Because cwd
   is deliberately moved to WT before each wave (¶3), an un-`-C`'d `git` would hit the wrong locus.
   - **MAIN locus** (`git -C "<MAIN>" …`): bundle discovery, gate-resolution **state** commits, the
     `branchExists` predicate. (The teardown's merge + `worktree remove`, the sweep, and the archive
     commit now run inside `mp` — §2c/¶5/¶7 — with the same `-C` discipline in code.)
   - **WT locus** (`git -C "<WT>" …`): code edits, the D6 `before`/`after` capture, `verify-scope`
     reverts, the **code** commit, and the `pr` push. **Every `git rev-parse HEAD` this shell runs is
     the CODE tip → `git -C "<WT>" rev-parse HEAD`** (the §2c snapshot itself is inside `mp
     finish-step`). The orchestrator's own git NEVER relies on ambient cwd — re-derive
     MAIN→WT→branch from the slug each turn (compaction-safe).
   - **Sole sanctioned bare git:** the ¶1 bootstrap `git rev-parse --path-format=absolute
     --git-common-dir` that *derives* MAIN. It is cwd-independent by construction (it resolves the same
     common git dir from MAIN or any linked worktree), so it cannot be `-C`-qualified — it is the very
     thing that computes the `-C` target. Once MAIN is known, every other git is `-C`-qualified by locus.

3. **cwd is a WRITE-ONLY signal to the about-to-launch agents — never read it back.** Subagents (both
   Agent-tool and Workflow-spawned) inherit the orchestrator's POST-`cd` cwd. So immediately before
   each L2 wave launch, `cd "<WT>"` — the implementers then inherit cwd=WT and their relative-path
   edits land on `masterplan/<slug>`. The shell NEVER reads cwd back to decide a locus (every shell git
   is explicit-`-C`, ¶2). `execute.workflow.js`'s "your launch cwd IS the target repo (${repoRoot})"
   holds iff we cd'd to WT and pass `repoRoot:<WT>` in the launch args.

4. **Create-or-reuse — internalized in `mp continue`.** The worktree probe (`branchExists` +
   `worktreeRegistered`, the crash-between-`add`-and-record guard), the `git worktree add`, and the
   durable `state.worktree` record all run inside `mp continue` before each launch op
   (`lib/continue.mjs` `ensureWorktree`, composing `lib/worktree.mjs` `planWorktreeCreate`). The
   shell never creates a run worktree by hand; teardown is likewise internalized (¶7, inside
   `mp finish-step` — `mp worktree record --choice=…` stays as the manual out-of-band recorder).

5. **Global orphan sweep — `mp sweep`, once per SESSION at first §2 entry (a dead run can't reap
   itself).** Teardown for an abandoned/crashed run is done by the NEXT live runner. Classification
   (the proof-gated ladder in `lib/worktree.mjs`) and execution both live in the subcommand: dry-run
   by default (report-only), `--apply` executes repair / prune / `worktree remove --force` (a
   registered crash-leak of OUR retired bundle) / `rm -rf` + prune (a PROVABLY-foreign leftover) /
   the durable `normalize` state rewrite. `manual` is NEVER automated in either mode (the proof-gate
   deliberately withholds the unprovable cases — `foreign-unverified`, `active-unregistered`,
   `duplicate-ownership`; the live `.worktrees/cc3-visibility` orphan classifies `foreign-unverified`
   → manual → stays human-gated) — surface its `skipped` entries as WARNs. This is the only
   crash-leak reaper; only the sweep is session-gated (re-running it every wave is wasteful + noisy).

6. **Split commit — state and code commit SEPARATELY, to two loci/branches.**
   - **Code** → WT, path-scoped to the wave's in-scope files ONLY — NEVER `add -A` / `commit -am`
     (WT's frozen bundle-dir checkout, if present, must not be swept into the branch).
   - **State** → `docs/masterplan/<slug>` in MAIN (Guard D sentinels excluded by pathspec).
   - On the wave path BOTH commits execute inside `mp record-result` (`lib/wave-commit.mjs`). The
     LEADING durable action is its atomic state WRITE, then code commit (WT), then state commit
     (MAIN) — so any crash prefix re-derives: `mp continue` re-runs the tail inline (the
     `finalize_run` reconcile: `mp record-result --reconcile`) off the persisted
     `active_run.{scope,baseline}` (a clean WT no-ops down to the marker clear). On the finish path
     the same two-loci discipline runs inside `mp finish-step` (§2c) — the task-scope dirty-commit in
     WT, the gate/archive bundle commits in MAIN.

7. **Teardown — internalized in `mp finish-step` (§2c).** The `--choice` resolution transaction runs
   the disposition git in MAIN — for merge, only after the target guard passes (MAIN's checked-out
   branch must equal the detected base; mismatch → `dispatch-error`, nothing merged) — `merge
   --no-edit masterplan/<slug>` (a conflict aborts cleanly and surfaces as `dispatch-error`; the gate
   stays open), then for merge / discard `worktree remove "<WT>"` (`--force` only on discard or an
   explicit `--removal-force`; an already-absent WT path counts as removal-confirmed — `worktree
   prune` reconciles git's metadata — so a crash between remove and record retires cleanly on replay)
   and a best-effort branch retire (`-d` after merge, `-D` on discard). keep / pr → no removal. The
   disposition is recorded from the ACTUAL removal outcome via `dispositionAfterTeardown(choice,
   confirmed)`: merge/discard + confirmed → `removed_after_merge`; keep/pr → `kept_by_user`;
   merge/discard + NOT confirmed → `active` (teardown retried on the next sweep — never the phantom
   `missing`). The recorded retirement value is what arms the §2c re-entry guard, so a replayed
   `--choice` never re-runs the action. Only the network half (push + PR) returns to the shell, as
   the `shell push_pr` op — and `pr` retires nothing until the shell confirms with `--pushed`.
   `mp worktree record --choice=…` remains available as the manual recorder for out-of-band teardowns.

8. **Owner sentinel — Guard D, cross-session mutual exclusion (NFS-safe).** Two sessions (possibly on
   different NFS clients — epyc1/epyc2) must not operate the SAME bundle concurrently. `writeState` is an
   atomic WRITE, not a test-and-set, so a `state.yml` owner *field* can't lock; Guard D is a SEPARATE
   sentinel (`<MAIN>/docs/masterplan/<slug>/.owner.lock` + per-owner `.owner.hb.<host>.<session>`),
   created by an atomic `link()` and confirmed via `stat().nlink` — all FILESYSTEM ops in `mp` (no git,
   no CD-7 conflict; the lock is NOT state.yml). The identity is the **LLM session** (`CLAUDE_CODE_SESSION_ID`),
   not the ephemeral `mp` process — stable across this session's turns, so the gate is idempotent.
   - **Acquire** at kickoff — inside `mp continue` (every §2 entry with an active bundle; `blocked` →
     the §2 `ask:'owner-blocked'` AUQ; the per-entry re-acquire doubles as the open-turn heartbeat).
   - **Heartbeat** before the state-mutating completion — executed INSIDE `mp record-result` (step 0
     of its transaction; `lost-to-other` → it returns with zero writes, a second session took over).
   - **Release** at finish — inside `mp finish-step`'s archive transaction (§2c), after the archive
     commit (frees the bundle so no successor is blocked).
   - **Liveness is heartbeat-age TTL only** (default 30m, must exceed the max single background wave — an
     LLM session is not a probeable process, so there is no same-host PID check). A crashed session's
     lock ages out after the TTL and the next acquirer `steal`s it; the `owner-sentinel` doctor check
     WARNs on a stale/corrupt lock (or an orphan heartbeat) and recommends `mp release-owner --force`.
   - `--force` (on acquire or release) is the human takeover — never auto-invoked under any autonomy.
   - **Guarantee (and its honest limit).** Guard D gives PERFECT mutual exclusion for **live** contention —
     a fresh contended lock is an atomic `link()` create, so two live sessions never both proceed. The unit
     of protection is the **turn** (re-heartbeat inside `mp continue` / `mp record-result`), not the individual write. The one
     residual, accepted by design (perfect single-writer is impossible on NFS without a lock manager): a
     `>TTL`-abandoned owner that resurrects at the exact instant a reclaimer breaks its lock. Narrow, benign,
     documented — NOT a gap to close with another mechanism.

## 3 — Other verbs (sequencing only — content lives elsewhere)

| verb | v8 target |
|---|---|
| `full` / `brainstorm` / `plan` | Locate the bundle, or **seed a new one** — `mp seed --state=<path> --slug=<slug> --topic="<topic>" [--complexity=… --autonomy=… --planning-mode=serial\|parallel\|auto --adversary-review=on\|off --predecessor-transcript=…]` (writes a valid v8 brainstorm-phase bundle; refuses an existing one unless `--force`). `--adversary-review` defaults `on` (alias: `--codex-review`) — new bundles arm `state.review.adversary: true` automatically (the hindsight-historian fix: the finish-time review was silently skipping because the flag was never set at seed). Pass `off` for explicit opt-out. **Brainstorm:** invoke `superpowers:brainstorming` directly. **Before the spec is presented for approval — a hard pre-approval requirement, not optional —** persist an `## Assumptions & Open Decisions` section into `spec.md`: one table row per material decision, columns `question | decision | rationale | source` where `source` is `assumed` or `user-confirmed`. This section is written INTO `spec.md`, so it falls under the **spec-gate hash coverage** (§3b — spec gate → `[spec.md]`) and gets reviewed and frozen with the rest of the spec; the spec may only reach the approval gate once it is present. On spec approval, **capture goals first** — auto-distill the spec's success criteria into `<MAIN>/docs/masterplan/<slug>/goals.md` (a dispatch/AUQ pass proposing the goal list; `goals.md` is an ARTIFACT, not CD-7 state, so the `Write` is allowed) and freeze it with `mp goals-load --state=<path> --goals=<MAIN>/docs/masterplan/<slug>/goals.md` **only after the user approves the distilled list** (that approval is the receipt setting `goals_frozen` to the current `goals.md` hash). Fail-closed via the **`run_goals_capture` guard**: on a goals-enabled bundle `mp set-phase --phase=plan` exits 3 with a `run_goals_capture` op until `goals_frozen` matches the current `goals.md` hash. Then `mp set-phase --state=<path> --phase=plan` (this transition trips the **spec gate** — §3b: it exits 3 with a `run_gate_review` op until the cross-vendor adversarial pass over `spec.md` + `goals.md` recorded via `mp record-gate-review --gate=spec` (the spec-gate hash now covers `spec.md` + `goals.md`, so a later `mp goals-amend` to the frozen goals re-arms this spec gate on its next transition); satisfy it, re-run set-phase) + `mp event --state=<path> --type=phase_transition --phase=plan` (never hand-edit `state.yml` — CD-7). **Plan:** hand to the **plan lifecycle (§3a)**, which selects serial vs parallel per `planning.mode`, then materializes `state.tasks` **and** advances `phase→execute` in one atomic `mp load-plan` write (the plan→execute seam; the lower-level `mp seed-tasks` populates tasks *without* touching phase, for recovering an already-`execute` bundle). The seam is guard-enforced: `mp set-phase --phase=execute` refuses a 0-task bundle without `--force`, and `decide` *throws* on a `phase:execute` + `tasks:[]` bundle rather than finalizing an unseeded run — so a bare `set-phase execute` can never silently archive a planned-but-unseeded run. Log other milestones with `mp event …`; gates via `mp open-gate` + an `AskUserQuestion`. (`brainstorm` stops once the plan phase is reached; `plan` runs §3a; `full` continues through execution via §2.) |
| `execute` | The resume controller (§2). |
| `finish` | The finalization verb → the flow in **§2c** (docs-normalize offer → verify → retro → durable `branch_finish` gate → archive **LAST**). Bare `finish` = run §2c (on pending tasks, AUQ "finalize anyway / keep working / `--retro-only`" — never silent-archive an incomplete run). `finish --retro-only` = (re)generate `retro.md` only — no verification, no gate, no archive (the old `retro` behavior); safe on an in-progress or finished run, and it must NOT `set-status archived` (that would strand a run: the §2 discover filter hides archived bundles). |
| `retro` | Deprecated alias for `finish --retro-only`. Print a one-line "`retro` was renamed to `finish` (running `finish --retro-only`)" notice, then run it. Kept for muscle-memory/back-compat. |
| `import` | Legacy intake → a v8 bundle: `mp migrate-bundle` an in-place legacy `state.yml` (backs up the original). **On a pre-5.0 refusal the §2 `ask:'legacy-refused'` rule applies: do NOT raw-rewrite `state.yml` (CD-7) — treat the legacy bundle as read-only and `mp seed` a fresh one, finish under v7, or stop and ask.** |
| `doctor` | `node "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/bin/doctor.mjs" [--fix]`. **[checks = step 5.]** |
| `status` | Read-only: `mp decide` (no writes) + a one-screen situation report from `state.yml`. **PR-aware** (PR probe ↓): if the branch has an open PR, append the `↪ Open PR #<n> …` line. **Goals-aware:** on a goals-enabled bundle `mp status` renders a **goals block** (the frozen `goals.md` goals + any recorded goal-check verdict) — the anti-forgetting surface so the run's goals stay visible between waves. |
| `validate` | Parse-check `state.yml` + config; report findings. No writes. |
| `stats` | `jq` roll-up over `events.jsonl` if present (replaces the v7 telemetry scripts). |
| `clean` | Archive (`mp set-status --state=<path> --status=archived`) / prune completed bundles. **PR-aware:** before archiving a bundle whose branch has an open PR, AUQ-**warn** (`bundle <slug>: branch has open PR #<n> — archive anyway?`) — warn, don't hard-block (archiving doesn't touch the PR; the user may still want the bundle gone). |
| `next` | **Action router, not a blocker:** call `mp continue` and execute the returned non-gate op. `next --dry-run` / `status` are the report-only paths. On hosts without Claude Code Workflow handles (including Pi), use `mp continue --no-workflow` / the auto-detected no-Workflow path so a launch-gap marker is consumed as foreground dispatch instead of surfaced as a loop. **PR-aware:** if the branch has an open PR, append the **advisory** `↪ Open PR #<n> ready — merge on GitHub or via /masterplan finish` (advisory only — never a `decide` action, never a blocking AUQ; this is how "a PR to merge" enters the what-do-I-do-next routine without becoming a per-resume nag). |
| `verbs` | Print the reserved-verb list above. |
| `render` | Re-render the bundle's `plan.html` with **live** per-task status from `state.tasks`: `mp render-plan --state=<path>`. **Read-only** — never writes `state.yml`. A static `plan.html` (all tasks `pending`) is also **auto-emitted** at the plan→execute seam (`mp load-plan`), so this verb refreshes it mid/post-execution. Deterministic, self-contained (inline CSS + wave SVG), no network/secrets. Headless: turn it into a PNG with `preview <path>` for an image. |
| `publish` | **Lead → GitHub coordination** (spec §7 — **IMPLEMENTED-UNVERIFIED**, never dogfooded end-to-end). Full procedure: [`docs/coordination-playbook.md`](../docs/coordination-playbook.md) §publish — bootstrap defaults (`mp set-coord --bootstrap`) → preflight (`mp coord-status --fail-if-unpublishable`) → provision the `mp-coord/<slug>/<plan_hash>` contract ref + `mp-int/<slug>` integration branch → one `gh issue create` per unpublished wave task (`mp gh-issue-body`, `mp update-issue-map`) → `mp set-coord --mark-published` + commit. **Follow the playbook exactly — do not improvise the steps from memory.** |
| `follow` | **Follower session → claim + deliver one task** (spec §7 — same playbook, same caveat). Full procedure: [`docs/coordination-playbook.md`](../docs/coordination-playbook.md) §follow — preflight → claim (`mp select-claimable`, assign, `mp validate-claim` won/lost) → build on branch `mp/<slug>/t<id>` from the pinned contract ref (ephemeral bundle outside `docs/masterplan/`) → D6 `verify-scope` + `verify_commands` → PR to `mp-int/<slug>` on pass, release the claim on fail. |

**PR probe (`status` · `next` · `clean` — never auto-merge).** These three verbs check
for an open PR on the run's branch. `status` and `clean` are report/control verbs; `next` still executes the
resume router when there is local work to do, but the PR line remains advisory and never auto-merges. Run **shell-side** (the established split — the shell owns git/`gh`,
`bin` is fs-only): resolve `branch` = `state.branch` or, as a fallback, `git -C "<WT>" rev-parse
--abbrev-ref HEAD` (the run branch is checked out in **WT**, §2e¶2 — `-C`-qualified, not bare), then
`gh pr list --head "<branch>" --state open --json number,title,mergeable,url 2>/dev/null` piped to
`mp pr-summary --gh-json='<output>'` → `{hasPr, number, title, url, mergeable}` (`mergeable ∈
yes|no|unknown` — GitHub computes it lazily, so a fresh PR reports `unknown`). `gh` is **best-effort**:
missing / unauthed / no remote / non-GitHub origin → empty → `{hasPr:false}` → no PR line, no error
(it must never break a read-only report). It is **report-only** — masterplan never auto-merges; a merge
happens only via the §2c `branch_finish` gate's Merge path or the user on GitHub. By design this lives
**only** in these human-invoked verbs (+ the §2c gate), **never** in the per-turn `decide` loop — a
"merge your PR" on every resume tick would be the exact over-asking nag the §2d contract kills.

## 3a — Plan lifecycle (serial | parallel — the `planning.mode` gate)

Reached when a bundle is in `phase=plan` with no plan yet: from §3's `full`/`plan` seed path (after
brainstorm's spec is approved and `mp set-phase plan` ran) and from §2's `run_skill resume-phase` op. Selects
between the serial `superpowers:writing-plans` path and the parallel fan-out (§2b) per `planning.mode`.

1. **Resolve the mode.** `serial | parallel | auto`, from the `resume-phase` op's `planning_mode`
   (default `auto`); set at seed via `mp seed --planning-mode=…`. Under host suppression the op
   always carries `serial` (`mp continue` forces it — the plan fan-out needs the Workflow tool,
   which a suppressed host lacks); never route a suppressed host to the parallel branch.
2. **Decompose (unless `serial`).** For `parallel`/`auto`, dispatch `agents/mp-spec-decomposer` against
   `spec.md` → `{ subsystems, recommend_parallel, reason }`.
   - `parallel` → parallel branch (step 4) with this decomposition.
   - `auto` → parallel **iff** `recommend_parallel && subsystems.length ≥ 2`; otherwise serial (step 3).
     Carry the decomposer's `reason` into your narration.
   - `serial` → skip the decomposer → step 3.
3. **Serial path.** Dispatch the `masterplan:mp-planner` agent against the approved `spec.md` → it writes
   both `plan.md` and `plan.index.json` directly (sole producer). **Model provenance (non-negotiable):** the
   planner runs on its checked-in frontmatter default *because it is dispatched by name* — that is the governed
   path. Do **not** substitute a raw model override (`subagent({ model: "litellm/opus-4.8" })`) to get Write
   access. If a dispatch class is used for the judgment instead (e.g. `architecture` for opus-tier design), it is
   **chat-only** — apply **orchestrator-as-writer**: the dispatch returns the plan content, the **parent writes**
   `plan.md`/`plan.index.json`; never bypass to a raw-frontier `subagent()` for the writes. See
   `docs/policy/dispatch.md#model-provenance-and-direct-subagent-dispatch`. Gate it:
   `mp validate-plan-index --plan-index=<plan_index_path>` (on failure, fix and re-parse — never advance
   on an invalid index). Then satisfy the **plan gate** (§3b — `mp load-plan` exits 3 with a `run_gate_review`
   op until the cross-vendor pass is recorded via `mp record-gate-review --gate=plan`) and **`mp load-plan --state=<path> --plan-index=<plan_index_path>`**
   (materializes `state.tasks` from the plan **and** advances `phase→execute` atomically — a bare
   `set-phase execute` would leave `tasks:[]` and the next `decide` would `complete`→archive the bundle)
   + `mp event --state=<path> --type=phase_transition --phase=execute`, `git -C "<MAIN>"` commit the
   bundle (MAIN-resident, §2e¶2), and hand to the resume controller (§2 — `mp continue` returns the
   wave-1 `launch_workflow` op, creating-or-reusing the worktree itself per §2e¶4; the single
   creation home is `mp continue`, never here).
4. **Parallel path.** Hand the decomposition to **§2b**'s plan launch (background fan-out → merge →
   validate → `mp-plan-reviewer` → execute). The phase advances to `execute` inside §2b's completion
   gate, not here.

Both paths converge on the same post-condition — a validated `plan.index.json` + `plan.md`, the
plan's tasks materialized into `state.tasks` and `phase=execute` (both via `mp load-plan`), committed
— after which §2 drives the wave loop.

**Optional generated images (`state.render.images`) — the plan→execute seam step.** After the plan gate resolves and `mp load-plan` has materialized `state.tasks` + advanced `phase→execute` (BOTH the serial §3a path above and the parallel §2b PASS path converge here), if — and only if — the bundle's `state.render.images` is `on`, the **SHELL** (never `mp` — `mp` never touches the network or a secret) dispatchs image generation through the **skynet gateway image lane** for the slot-name convention `assets/{hero,wave-<n>}.png` (one `hero.png` plus one `wave-<n>.png` per wave), writes the resulting PNGs into the bundle's assets dir `<MAIN>/docs/masterplan/<slug>/assets/`, then re-runs `mp render-plan --state=<path>` so the fresh `plan.html` embeds them. **No API key, the lane down, or the flag `off` → SKIP silently**: the render is already complete regardless (embedding is **by-presence** — `render-plan` never consults `state.render.images`; the flag gates GENERATION only, so assets already on disk keep rendering after the flag is turned off, and deleting `assets/` un-embeds them). This step is what makes the flag real: without it the `mp set-render-config --images=on` and `mp seed --render-images=on` setters are inert. It is purely additive at the seam — never a gate, never blocking; a failed or skipped generation leaves the deterministic, secret-free render untouched.

## 3b — Pre-execute adversary-review gates (spec & plan) — the `run_gate_review` op

The two pre-execute transitions are **structurally gated** on a recorded cross-vendor adversarial pass:
the **spec gate** fires on `mp set-phase --phase=plan` (brainstorm→plan); the **plan gate** fires on
`mp load-plan` AND `mp set-phase --phase=execute` (plan→execute). The guard lives in `bin`
(`lib/gate-review.mjs` is its pure core): it recomputes a content hash over the CURRENT gated artifacts
— spec gate → `[spec.md]`; plan gate → `[spec.md, plan.md, plan.index.json]` (the index hashed with its
own self-stamped `plan_hash`/`generated_at` stripped, so a re-stamp never moves the hash) — and looks
for a review event recorded at that hash. **No record → the subcommand exits 3 and prints one op JSON:
`{op:'run_gate_review', gate, hash, artifacts, message}`.** Editing any gated artifact changes the hash
and RE-ARMS the gate — a stale review never satisfies an edited spec/plan. The guard is **unconditional
and fail-closed**: it never reads a `state` flag, so a legacy/migrated bundle with no recorded review
re-arms on its next transition (no `lib/migrate.mjs` change needed).

**Exit 3 is the gate, NOT the loud invariant.** The §2 rule "a non-zero exit is a loud invariant — read
stderr" still holds for every OTHER non-zero exit; **exit 3 carrying a `run_gate_review` op** is the
distinct, EXPECTED signal that the mandatory cross-vendor pass has not run yet for these artifacts. Do
not surface it as an error — satisfy it:

1. **Run the lane** over `op.artifacts`, foreground, through the agent-dispatch control plane's adversary
   lane (NO model named — `class=adversary`, `intensity=rigorous` resolve to a cross-vendor reviewer
   engine-side): `mcp__agent-dispatch__dispatch_review` with the gated artifacts as the review target.
   This is the SAME cross-vendor adversary lane the finish gate uses (§2c `run_adversary_review`), applied
   at the spec- and plan-approval boundaries — the two points where a design error is cheapest to fix.
2. **On a real review (the lane returned findings):** `Write` a brief digest (finding count + the top
   severity-ordered findings, never the raw dump) to `<bundle>/gate-<gate>-review-digest.txt`
   (absolute-MAIN, §2e¶1; the Write tool is not shell-evaluated, so arbitrary review bytes are safe —
   never interpolate them into a shell word). **Surface the findings to the user** — the whole point is
   that a blocking finding at the spec/plan boundary should CHANGE the artifact, not just get logged: if
   the pass found blocking issues, treat it as REVISE — fix the spec/plan (which re-arms the gate at the
   new hash) and re-run the lane. Otherwise record it satisfied with a **structured receipt** that binds
   the recorded `done` to the actual lane call (a bare `--status=done` is no longer accepted):
   1. `mp gate-hash --state=<path> --gate=<op.gate>` → `{ hash, artifacts }`. For the **plan** gate via
      `load-plan`, pass the SAME `--plan-index`/`--plan-md` the load uses; the **spec** gate and BOTH
      `set-phase` paths take NO path flags — their artifacts are always the canonical in-bundle
      `spec.md`/`plan.md`/`plan.index.json` (realpath-confined to the bundle; a flag can't redirect them).
   2. `Write` a receipt JSON to `<bundle>/gate-<gate>-receipt.json` with EXACTLY these fields:
      `{ "gate":"<op.gate>", "hash":"<from gate-hash>", "artifacts":<from gate-hash>,
      "dispatch_id":"<lane dispatch id>", "provider":"<lane provider>", "model":"<lane model>",
      "output_tokens":<lane completion tokens>, "status":"done", "ts":"<iso>", "digest":"<findings text>" }`.
      The `dispatch_id`/`provider`/`model`/`output_tokens` come straight from the `dispatch_review` result —
      so a fabricated `done` cannot pass without an actual lane call having produced tokens.
   3. `mp record-gate-review --state=<path> --gate=<op.gate> --status=done --receipt=<that receipt.json>
      --count=<n> [--base=<base|''>]` (passing the SAME `--plan-index`/`--plan-md` for the
      plan-via-`load-plan` gate). The recorder recomputes the hash + artifact set and REJECTS (exit 1) a
      receipt that doesn't echo them, or that lacks provenance/positive tokens.
   Then **re-run the original transition** — it now passes.
3. **Skip ONLY on a genuine, evidenced lane failure** — a non-zero lane exit, the lane/gateway
   unreachable, `agent-dispatch` missing, empty output. Capture the REAL error to a file and record it:
   `mp record-gate-review --state=<path> --gate=<op.gate> --status=skipped --reason="<the actual error,
   verbatim-tight>" --digest-file=<captured stderr>` — **both `--reason` (non-empty) AND `--digest-file`
   (readable, non-empty) are REQUIRED**: a skip must carry evidence the operator looked, not a bare bypass.
   Then re-run the transition (a recorded skip satisfies the gate — this lane is fail-soft by policy,
   docs/policy/dispatch.md). **A skip is an evidenced lane outage, never a convenience.** Do NOT record
   `skipped` because the review is inconvenient, slow, or "probably fine", and NEVER as an unconditional
   "lane errored → skip → proceed" reflex — a casual skip rebuilds the exact hole these gates exist to
   close (a recorded-but-unrun review is, after the fact, indistinguishable from the silent skip that
   motivated this whole mechanism). If the lane is merely slow or you are unsure it truly failed, RETRY the
   lane; do not skip.

The gates are advisory in RESULT (a clean pass and an evidenced skip both advance) but mandatory in
STEP (the run-and-record cannot be bypassed except by `--force`, reserved for the documented
recovery/test paths — never a routine skip; a `--force` bypass appends a `<gate>_gate_bypassed` audit
event so the shortcut is never silent). This is the structural inverse of the old failure mode,
where "advisory" was misread as "optional" and the pass was silently skipped. Read-only status of a
gate at any time: `mp gate-review-status --state=<path> --gate=<spec|plan>`.

## 4 — Turn-close (CD-9)

End any turn that needs input with `AskUserQuestion` (2–4 concrete options) — never a free-text
question (sessions compact between turns; a free-text prompt becomes a dead end) and never a silent
stop while a decision is pending. Completion is no longer a silent archive either — the §2c
finalization flow always surfaces the `branch_finish` gate (a risky-action AUQ) before archiving.

**Under `autonomy ∈ {loose, full}`, "needs input" means one of the §2d stop-set gates — nothing else.**
A turn that finished useful work but hit no gate **auto-progresses**: do the obvious next safe step in
the same turn (record → commit → dispatch the next wave) and close **without** an AUQ, ending the
text with the `<mp-autoprogress>` marker (§2d) so the global guard stands down. Do **not** manufacture a
"what next?" / "run codex?" / "Ready for Wave N" question — that over-asking is exactly what §2d forbids.
Reserve the AUQ for the genuine stop-set.

Otherwise close cleanly. What's gone from v7 is the *hook-driven per-turn* ceremony — trace
markers, breadcrumbs, and summary-block signals fired on every turn by Stop-hook machinery. v8
consolidates these into a single prompt-driven close: the **CC-3-trampoline** sequence defined in-file
at §2d "Turn-close routing", which emits the summary block + exit breadcrumb **once, at turn-close**,
then closes with this AUQ at a stop-set gate. (The §0 version banner is an *invocation*-time
obligation — first, before anything — not part of turn-close.) That sequence is the only ceremony
that survives.

## 6.5 — Multi-repo apply (qctl backend) — flag-off spec, relocated

The qctl GPU-worker implementer backend's multi-repo apply/verify/commit procedure is a **spec for a
feature that is OFF** (`state.implementer.qctl.enabled` — nothing sets it yet). The full sequence
lives in `docs/design/qctl-multi-repo-apply.md`; do not execute any of it unless that flag is true.
