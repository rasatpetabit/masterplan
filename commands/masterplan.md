# /masterplan — thin resumable shell (v8)

> v8 clean-core. The DECISIONS live in `lib/*.mjs` behind `bin/masterplan.mjs` (deterministic,
> zero-LLM-token, unit-tested) — this shell only **sequences**. Durable state lives in
> `docs/masterplan/<slug>/` (`state.yml` is the source of truth). CD-7: the shell is the SOLE
> state writer, via `bin` — **never** hand-edit, `Write`, or `Edit` `state.yml` or `events.jsonl`;
> every mutation goes through an `mp` subcommand (`seed`, `set-phase`, `set-status`, `mark-task`,
> `load-plan`, `open-gate`, `clear-gate`, `event`, …). A raw `Write`/`Edit` both violates CD-7 **and** floods the screen with the file diff
> (anti-flood) — `mp` writes the file server-side and returns one terse JSON line. Work goes to
> dedicated agents (`agents/*.md`), the L2 Workflow engine (`workflows/execute.workflow.js`), and
> `superpowers` skills — never run substantive work inline in this context (it holds sequencing state only).

Throughout, **`mp`** denotes `node "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/bin/masterplan.mjs"`. Every decision and
every state write goes through it. It is fs-only — **git (commit, and the recover-path
`git checkout`) is this shell's job, not `bin`'s.** Results print as JSON on stdout; on a non-zero
exit, read stderr and act on it.

## 0 — Boot (every invocation, unconditional)

1. **Version banner — FIRST, before anything else**, even on a compaction-resume / `invoked_skills`
   re-injection (it is the lone CC-2 survivor; build NO enforcement/telemetry apparatus around it):
   run `mp version --args="<verbatim $ARGUMENTS, or empty>" --cwd="<repo root or pwd>"` and print the
   single line it returns.
2. **Host detect.** Run `mp detect-host` with the signals you can observe (`--agent-is-codex` if the
   session identifies the agent as Codex, `--native-tools` if Codex-native tools like `apply_patch`/
   `update_plan` are exposed, `--agents-md` if an `AGENTS.md` is present). If the result's
   `suppressRescue` is true, do NOT dispatch the `codex:codex-rescue` companion anywhere this
   invocation (it would recurse — Codex calling Codex). The same true result is the
   **`codex_host_suppressed`** condition the downstream paths check: it gates the Claude-Code-only
   native task tools in §2a recovery (`recover_and_redispatch` / `recover_plan_run`) and supplies
   `mp prepare-wave --codex-suppressed`. Persisted `codex.routing`/`codex.review` are
   unaffected.

## 1 — Parse the verb

Reserved verbs: `full, brainstorm, plan, execute, finish, retro, import, doctor, status, validate,
stats, clean, next, verbs, publish, follow`. Precedence:

0. **No args** → the **resume controller** (§2).
1. First token is a reserved verb → that verb; consume it, the rest are its args.
2. First arg starts with `--` → `--resume=<path>` / `--resume <path>` alias `execute <path>`;
   other `--flags` are config overrides.
3. Otherwise → treat the whole arg string as a **brainstorm topic** (catch-all).

A topic literally named after a reserved verb needs a word in front (`/masterplan add plan timer`).

## 2 — Resume controller (bare entry, `execute`, and after every durable transition)

The spine. It NEVER decides in prose — it asks `mp decide` and executes the returned action.

1. **Locate the bundle.** `execute <path>` → that `state.yml`. Else discover
   `docs/masterplan/*/state.yml` whose status is not archived: exactly one → use it; several → an
   `AskUserQuestion` picker; none → there is no active run (route by verb, or offer to start one).
2. **Migrate-on-load if legacy.** Run `mp migrate-bundle --state=<path>`. If it reports
   `migrated:true`, the tasks now carry `wave:null` — ensure a `plan.index.json` exists (re-parse
   `plan.md` via the `masterplan:mp-planner` agent if it's missing), then
   `mp backfill-waves --state=<path> --plan-index=<path>` so every task carries a real wave. **If it
   instead REFUSES** (pre-5.0 floor / unparseable legacy — the deliberate R3 refusal), do **NOT**
   raw-rewrite `state.yml` to schema 6 (a CD-7 violation). Treat the legacy bundle as read-only
   reference and either `mp seed` a FRESH schema-6 bundle (re-deriving its tasks via the §3
   brainstorm→plan→`load-plan` path), finish the run under masterplan v7, or stop and ask the user.
3. **Probe liveness — or catch a completion.** If `state.active_run` has a `task_id`:
   - **A Workflow completion notification re-invoked you** and its `<result>{…}</result>` (run/task
     matching `active_run`) is in front of you → do NOT probe or `decide` yet: first run the
     **completion protocol — §2a for an execute wave, §2b for a planning run** (branch on
     `active_run.kind`: `'plan'` → §2b, else → §2a) to record the in-hand digests (execute: mark each
     `done`, D6 `verify-scope`, commit; plan: merge fragments → validate → review → advance).
     Recording BEFORE `decide` is load-bearing — a finished run whose tasks are still
     `pending` on disk looks like a crash to `decide` (→ `recover_and_redispatch`), so deciding first
     re-runs a wave you already hold results for. After recording, fall through to step 4 (no `--alive`).
   - **Otherwise** probe with `TaskGet(task_id)`: still running → pass `--alive` to step 4 (→ `wait`).
     Finished/absent with no result in hand (compaction dropped the notification) → no `--alive`
     (→ `decide` returns `recover_and_redispatch`; the reset + re-dispatch is idempotent).
   (A phase-1 `launching` marker has no `task_id` — skip the probe; `decide` treats it as crashed-in-launch.)
4. **Decide.** `mp decide --state=<path> [--alive]` → an action JSON. If it exits non-zero citing
   "backfill waves", the bundle wasn't backfilled — return to step 2; if it cites "phase is 'execute'
   but state.tasks is empty", the plan was never loaded into the bundle — run `mp seed-tasks
   --state=<path> --plan-index=<path>` to materialize the tasks (the bundle is already `phase:execute`,
   so seed-tasks alone suffices — the load-plan seam in §3/§3a was bypassed) before resuming.
5. **Execute the action.** After `finalize_run`, loop back to step 4 (re-decide); `dispatch_wave` /
   `recover_and_redispatch` / `recover_plan_run` end by awaiting a launched run; `resume_phase` hands
   to the plan lifecycle (§3a); `complete` runs the finalization flow (§2c); `wait` / `surface_gate` close.

   | action | do |
   |---|---|
   | `surface_gate` | Re-render the gate's `AskUserQuestion` (CD-9). A named option → act, `mp clear-gate`, commit, re-decide. Free-text / no clear answer → keep the gate, respond, close. NEVER auto-proceed regardless of autonomy (the durable marker outranks a native AUQ that can't survive compaction). For the finalization gates (`branch_finish`, `verification_failed`), the per-option **act** is specified in **§2c**. |
   | `wait` | A live run owns the wave. Report it and close — its Workflow completion notification re-invokes this controller, which records the result via the completion protocol (**§2a**, step 3). |
   | `finalize_run` | The wave's tasks are all `done` on disk. `mp clear-active-run`, commit, then re-decide (→ next wave, or `complete`). |
   | `recover_and_redispatch` | Crash recovery. If `staleTaskId` ≠ null: `TaskList` → `TaskStop` (**Claude Code only** — no-op when `codex_host_suppressed == true`, where the native task tools are absent and reconciliation leans on the on-disk `active_run` marker) any surviving run for it (a backgrounded Workflow MAY outlive session death — reconcile before touching files). Then RESET scope: `git checkout -- <resetPaths>` and, **only when `resetPaths` is non-empty**, `git clean -fd -- <resetPaths>` — scope the clean to the reset paths; a bare `git clean -fd` (or one with an empty pathspec) would wipe unrelated user-owned untracked files. Then dispatch the wave via **§2a**. Idempotent — agents never commit. |
   | `recover_plan_run` | Crash recovery for a planning fan-out (`active_run.kind:'plan'`). If `staleTaskId` ≠ null: `TaskList` → `TaskStop` (**Claude Code only** — no-op when `codex_host_suppressed == true`) any surviving run. **No git scope reset** — the subsystem drafters are read-only, so nothing was written to revert. Re-launch the fan-out via **§2b** (re-dispatch `mp-spec-decomposer` if the subsystem set isn't in hand). Idempotent. |
   | `dispatch_wave` | Launch one wave through the L2 engine — full sequence in **§2a**. In brief: `mp prepare-wave` (resolves routing) → capture the git baseline → `mp set-active-run --wave=N` (phase-1, BEFORE launch) → launch `workflows/execute.workflow.js` in the background with `args={wave,tasks,baseline,repoRoot,review}` → `mp promote-active-run --run-id=… --task-id=…` (phase-2) → close to await its completion notification. |
   | `resume_phase` | The bundle is mid-`{brainstorm\|plan}` with no plan built yet (`tasks:[]`). **Do NOT finalize/archive** — that would destroy a mid-design run. `phase==plan` → hand to the **plan lifecycle (§3a)** with the action's `planning_mode`. `phase==brainstorm` → re-entering an in-progress `superpowers:brainstorming` is still deferred (step 7), so SURFACE via `AskUserQuestion` — continue the phase, restart it, or stop — and close. Never fall through to `complete`. |
   | `complete` | All execute tasks done → the **finalization flow (§2c)**: verify-before-completion (cite output) → write `retro.md` → the durable `branch_finish` gate → archive **LAST**. NEVER a silent archive — the v8 regression §2c restores. |

6. **CD-7 commit discipline.** Each durable change = a `mp` write (atomic) FOLLOWED BY a `git commit`
   of the bundle. A crash between write and commit is safe — `state.yml` leads, resume re-commits.
   Wave members (agents / the L2 engine) return digests only; they NEVER write `state.yml` or commit,
   which is exactly what makes re-dispatch idempotent.

## 2a — Wave dispatch + completion protocol (the L1↔L2 seam)

`workflows/execute.workflow.js` (L2) runs **exactly one wave per launch**; this shell drives the
wave loop. A Workflow script has no module/fs/git access, so the shell resolves routing and captures
git *here*, threading data in via `args` and reading digests back out — the workflow itself only
dispatches agents and echoes the baseline.

**Launch** (the tail of `dispatch_wave`, and of `recover_and_redispatch` after its scope reset):

1. **Resolve the wave.** `mp prepare-wave --state=<path> --plan-index=<path> --wave=N
   [--codex-suppressed] [--linked-worktree]` → `{wave, tasks:[…lean, already-routed…], review}`. Pass
   `--codex-suppressed` when §0 host-detect set `suppressRescue`; pass `--linked-worktree` when
   `git rev-parse --git-dir` ≠ `--git-common-dir`. Routing (`routeTask`) is decided HERE, never in the
   workflow. (`prepare-wave` filters out `done` tasks, so a recover re-runs ONLY the incomplete ones.)
2. **Capture the D6 baseline.** `before = ( git -c core.quotePath=false diff --name-only HEAD ) ∪
   ( git ls-files -o --exclude-standard )` — the already-touched path set, as a JSON array.
3. **Phase-1 marker.** `mp set-active-run --state=<path> --wave=N` — written BEFORE launch so a crash
   in the launch gap resumes as `recover_and_redispatch`, not a blind re-dispatch.
4. **Launch in the background.** Start `workflows/execute.workflow.js` via the Workflow tool with
   `args = { wave:N, tasks:<step 1>, baseline:<step 2>, repoRoot:<repo>, review:<step 1's review> }`.
   Background so it outlives the turn; its completion notification re-invokes this controller.
5. **Phase-2 handles.** `mp promote-active-run --state=<path> --run-id=<id> --task-id=<id>` with the
   launched run's handles.
6. **Close** to await completion. Do NOT mark tasks or commit here — the engine has them in flight.

**Completion** (re-invoked holding the engine's `<result>` — reached from §2 step 3):

1. **Record digests — BEFORE any `decide`.** For each `result.tasks[i]`: `digest.status==='done'` →
   `mp mark-task --state=<path> --id=<id> --status=done`; `failed`/`blocked` → leave it `pending` and
   collect it to surface (those statuses are not writable — `recover_and_redispatch` re-runs them).
   Note any `review.verdict==='blocking'` to surface even on a `done` task.
2. **D6 scope verify.** Capture `after` (the same two git commands), then `mp verify-scope
   --state=<path> --wave=N --before='<result.baseline>' --after='<after>'`. On `ok:false` an agent
   wrote outside declared scope: revert the offenders — `git checkout -- <outOfScope>` and (non-empty)
   `git clean -fd -- <outOfScope>` — and surface the breach (`-fd`, matching the recover path, so an
   out-of-scope new directory is removed too). In-scope work stands.
3. **Commit once.** Commit `state.yml` AND the wave's in-scope file edits together. State leads git
   (CD-7): a crash before the commit re-derives from the marked-`done` state on the next resume.
   **Narrate tersely:** after the commit, print at most a 1–2 line wave summary (what completed /
   what's next) — NEVER echo the `state.yml` or `WORKLOG.md` diff to screen (anti-flood; the full
   record lives in the bundle + `git log`).
4. **Re-decide.** Re-enter step 4. With the wave's tasks now `done`, `decide` returns `finalize_run`
   (→ clear `active_run` → next wave, or `complete`); any task left `pending` (failed/blocked, or
   scope-reverted) drives `recover_and_redispatch` for ONLY those, idempotently. Surface failed/blocked
   tasks or a `blocking` verdict via `AskUserQuestion` (§4) — never silently loop.

## 2b — Parallel-plan dispatch + completion (the planning L1↔L2 seam)

`workflows/plan.workflow.js` (L2) fans out **one `mp-subsystem-planner` per subsystem** in a single
parallel barrier and returns **fragments only** — it never writes artifacts or commits. This shell
owns the decomposition (the subsystem list), the deterministic merge, and the gate. It mirrors §2a
**minus the wave loop and minus any scope capture** — the drafters are read-only, so there is no D6
baseline and no `verify-scope`. `active_run.kind:'plan'` carries **no wave**.

**Launch** (reached from §3a's parallel branch, and from `recover_plan_run`):

1. **Subsystems in hand.** Use the decomposition from §3a (`mp-spec-decomposer`'s `{subsystems}`). On
   `recover_plan_run` with none in hand, re-dispatch `mp-spec-decomposer` first — the fan-out is
   idempotent, so re-deriving the seam map is safe.
2. **Phase-1 plan marker.** `mp set-active-run --state=<path> --kind=plan` — a planning marker (no
   wave) written BEFORE launch so a crash in the launch gap resumes as `recover_plan_run`, not a
   blind re-dispatch.
3. **Launch in the background.** Start `workflows/plan.workflow.js` via the Workflow tool with
   `args = { subsystems:<step 1>, specPath:<spec_path>, repoRoot:<repo> }`. Background so it outlives
   the turn; its completion notification re-invokes this controller (→ §2 step 3 → here).
4. **Phase-2 handles.** `mp promote-active-run --state=<path> --run-id=<id> --task-id=<id>`.
5. **Close** to await completion. Do NOT merge or commit here — the fan-out is in flight.

**Completion** (re-invoked holding the engine's `<result>` = `{ subsystems:[…fragments…], specPath,
repoRoot }`, reached from §2 step 3 when `active_run.kind==='plan'`):

1. **Reconcile coverage.** Diff the returned fragment `key`s against the requested subsystem keys;
   **surface any missing subsystem** (a drafter that errored/skipped nulls out — never fake it). A
   missing drafter is a `REVISE`-class gate, not a silent drop.
2. **Stage the fragments.** Write the returned `subsystems` array to `<bundle-dir>/.plan-fragments.json`
   (a plain `Write` — `plan.index.json` / `plan.md` / fragments are **ARTIFACTS, not CD-7 state**, so
   this write is allowed outside the `mp`-only rule).
3. **Merge (deterministic).** `mp merge-plan-fragments --fragments=<bundle-dir>/.plan-fragments.json
   --out=<plan_index_path> --plan-md=<plan_path> --meta='{"title":"<topic>","spec":"<spec_path>"}'` —
   assigns global ids/waves, normalises `codex`, **validates BEFORE writing**, and stamps
   `plan_hash`/`generated_at` onto both artifacts. A merge error (dup key, dangling/cyclic dep, invalid
   index) exits non-zero and writes nothing — surface it and stop.
4. **Explicit gate.** `mp validate-plan-index --plan-index=<plan_index_path>` — the standalone strict
   check, the compensating layer now that fragments crossed a background-Workflow boundary (the
   `FRAGMENT` tool-schema enum guarded the foreground path; this re-guards `codex` shape + same-wave
   file-disjointness on disk).
5. **Review.** Dispatch `agents/mp-plan-reviewer` against `plan.md` / `plan.index.json` / `spec.md`
   → `PASS | REVISE | FAIL`.
   - **PASS** → `mp clear-active-run`; **`mp load-plan --state=<path> --plan-index=<plan_index_path>`**
     (materializes `state.tasks` from the plan **and** advances `phase→execute` in one atomic write — the
     plan→execute seam; a bare `set-phase execute` would leave `tasks:[]`, so the next `decide` would
     `complete`→archive the just-planned bundle) + `mp event --state=<path> --type=phase_transition
     --phase=execute`; commit `plan.index.json` + `plan.md` + `state.yml` together (terse 1–2 line
     narration, never the diff — anti-flood); then re-decide (§2 step 4 → `dispatch_wave`).
   - **REVISE / FAIL** (or a missing subsystem from step 1) → `mp clear-active-run`; surface the
     reviewer's findings via `AskUserQuestion` (§4) — revise-and-replan / accept-as-is (REVISE only) /
     stop — and keep `phase=plan`. Never auto-advance past a non-PASS verdict.

## 2c — Finalization flow (the `complete` action + the `finish` verb)

`complete` is no longer a silent archive — it is the umbrella **finish** flow: verify the work (and
cite it), write the retro, then surface a **durable** `branch_finish` gate before archiving. It
composes two `superpowers` skills — `verification-before-completion` (the authoritative claim-done
gate, step 3) and `finishing-a-development-branch` (executes the chosen disposition on resolve) —
driven by `mp finish-status` (the SHELL runs git and passes its output as flags; `bin` stays fs-only,
the §2a verify-scope pattern). **Every step is re-entrant** (disposition shortcut · verified-at-SHA
skip · write-if-absent), so a compaction at any point resumes cleanly. **Archive is LAST**: archiving
earlier strands the run — the §2-step-1 discover filter hides archived bundles, so the gate could
never re-surface (the one thing v7's flow got wrong; do not copy it).

**Snapshot first** (the SHELL runs git, `bin` stays fs-only): `mp finish-status --state=<path>
--head="$(git rev-parse HEAD)" --porcelain="$(git -c core.quotePath=false status --porcelain)"
--branches="$(git branch --format='%(refname:short)')"` → `{task_scope_dirty, task_scope_paths,
unrelated_dirty, base, retro_present, verified, verify_commands, worktree_disposition, dispositions}`.

1. **Branch already resolved? (re-entry shortcut).** If `worktree_disposition` is a retirement value
   (`removed_after_merge` | `kept_by_user`), the `branch_finish` gate was resolved AND executed in a
   prior turn (a compaction landed between resolve and archive) → jump to step 6 (archive). Else continue.
2. **Dirty check (thin net).** §2a commits at every wave boundary, so dirt is rare here. If
   `task_scope_dirty`, commit `task_scope_paths`. **Leave `unrelated_dirty` untouched** (protect-user-work).
   **Committing here moves HEAD** — re-run the `mp finish-status` snapshot (fresh `git rev-parse HEAD`)
   before step 3, so `verified` reflects the new commit; a stale `verified=true` carried from the
   pre-commit snapshot would otherwise skip verification on an as-yet-untested commit.
3. **Verification gate — `superpowers:verification-before-completion`.** If `verified` (a recorded SHA
   == HEAD) → skip (already proven at this commit). Else IDENTIFY → RUN fresh → **cite real output +
   exit code** (CD-3; "should pass" is not evidence). Command source: `verify_commands` (the union of
   the plan tasks'); if empty, the skill's own IDENTIFY; if STILL none under `--autonomy=full`,
   `mp open-gate --id=no_verification_command` + AUQ (specify one / proceed without) — never silently skip.
   - **PASS** → `mp record-verification --state=<path> --sha="$(git rev-parse HEAD)"` (durable; a
     re-entry at unchanged HEAD then skips the re-run).
   - **FAIL** → `mp open-gate --id=verification_failed` + AUQ (*Fix first & re-run* / *Proceed anyway
     (reviewed)* / *Abort finish*), close. Resolution = the surface_gate act, below.
4. **Retro (write-if-absent).** If `!retro_present`, generate `retro.md` (idempotent — a re-entry skips
   it). This subsumes the old `retro` verb.
5. **Branch-finish gate (durable — the v8 regression this restores).** First **probe for an open PR**
   on the branch (the §3 PR probe: `gh pr list --head "<branch>" … | mp pr-summary`). `mp open-gate
   --id=branch_finish`, then AUQ labelled with `base`: `Merge to <base> locally (Recommended)` · `Push
   and open a PR` · `Keep branch + worktree as-is` · `Discard everything` (the skill then requires a
   typed "discard"). **If the probe found a PR (`hasPr`), relabel the second option** → `View / merge
   open PR #<n> (mergeable: <yes|no|unknown>)` — the branch is already pushed with a PR open, so "open a
   PR" would be a duplicate. That option keeps the `pr` choice (→ `kept_by_user`): its resolution is a
   no-op push (the branch is already up) that just surfaces the existing PR URL, never opening a second
   one. This AUQ is the turn-close. On any resume while open, `decide` → `surface_gate`
   re-renders it (CD-9); a **free-text / "not ready" answer holds the gate and chats** (§2 surface_gate
   rule) — the "not done yet" escape, nothing archives.
6. **Archive LAST.** Reached only via step 1 (gate already resolved): `mp set-status --state=<path>
   --status=archived` (the sole archival mechanism — never hand-edit `state.yml`), commit, close. The
   §2 discover filter now hides the bundle → the run goes quiet. Done.

**Gate resolution** (the `surface_gate` **act** — the turn AFTER the user picks a named option):

- **`verification_failed`** — *Fix first*: `mp clear-gate`, close (fix code + commit, then re-invoke
  `finish`/resume → verification re-runs fresh and re-opens the gate if still red). *Proceed anyway*:
  `mp record-verification --state=<path> --sha="$(git rev-parse HEAD)"` (a reviewed override, so a
  re-entry doesn't re-loop the same failure) → `mp clear-gate` → re-decide (→ `complete` → §2c:
  verification now skipped → retro → `branch_finish`). *Abort finish*: `mp clear-gate`, close (the run
  stays resumable; nothing archived).
- **`no_verification_command`** — opened by §2c step 3 when no command is found under `--autonomy=full`.
  *Specify a command*: RUN it fresh, **cite output** (CD-3) → PASS: `mp record-verification
  --state=<path> --sha="$(git rev-parse HEAD)"` + `mp clear-gate` + re-decide (→ retro → `branch_finish`);
  FAIL: hand to `verification_failed` (`mp open-gate --id=verification_failed` overwrites the single
  `pending_gate` slot — no separate `clear-gate` needed; its acts are above). *Proceed
  without*: `mp record-verification --state=<path> --sha="$(git rev-parse HEAD)"` — the reviewed "no
  verification available" override (mirrors `verification_failed`'s *Proceed anyway* so a re-entry
  doesn't re-open this gate) — `mp clear-gate`, re-decide. Never silently skip verification or archive.
- **`branch_finish`** — **re-entry guard first:** re-read `mp finish-status`; if `worktree_disposition`
  is already a retirement value (`removed_after_merge` | `kept_by_user`), the action ran AND its
  disposition was recorded in a prior turn (a compaction landed before `clear-gate`) → do **not** re-run
  the action; just `mp clear-gate` + re-decide (→ `complete` → §2c step-1 shortcut → **archive**).
  Otherwise: delegate to `superpowers:finishing-a-development-branch` with the option **pre-decided** +
  **"tests verified at SHA `<X>`, base = `<base>`"** so it skips its own option prompt (a re-asserted
  hard-gate re-running a green suite at unchanged HEAD is redundant-but-harmless; if it double-prompts
  or fights the durable gate, run the git steps directly using the skill as reference). It executes
  merge / push+PR / discard / keep + worktree cleanup. (If the `pr` choice was taken on a branch that
  step 5's probe found **already has an open PR**, the push is a fast-forward no-op and no second PR is
  opened — surface the existing PR's URL.) **Immediately on success** record `mp
  set-worktree-disposition --state=<path> --disposition=<dispositions[choice]>` (the value from
  finish-status's `dispositions` map — `lib/finish.mjs` is its single source of truth, never hardcode
  the enum) — this is what arms the guard above against a re-entry — then `mp event --state=<path>
  --type=branch_finish --note=<choice>`, `mp clear-gate`, commit, re-decide → `complete` → §2c →
  step-1 shortcut → **archive**.

**Manual entry — `/masterplan finish`.** Bare `finish` locates the bundle and `mp decide`s: `complete`
→ run this flow; tasks still pending (or a run live) → AUQ "N task(s) pending — finalize anyway?
(→ §2c) / keep working (→ §2) / just re-write the retro (→ `--retro-only`)" — never silent-archive an
incomplete run. `finish --retro-only` runs **only** step 4 (the old `retro` behavior).

## 2d — Autonomy contract (loose / full — when a turn may auto-progress)

`state.autonomy` governs exactly ONE thing: whether a turn that finished useful work but hit **no
gate** may close **silently** (auto-progress) or must end with an `AskUserQuestion`. It does **not**
widen, narrow, or skip any gate — the gate set is identical at every autonomy level (`decide` doesn't
read `autonomy`; it only ever returns real actions). Under `autonomy ∈ {loose, full}` the orchestrator
**auto-progresses** and does NOT manufacture an end-of-turn question.

**The COMPLETE stop-set** — the *only* things that may end a turn with an AUQ under loose/full; if the
turn hit none of these, it MUST auto-progress, not ask:

- `surface_gate` for any durable gate: `branch_finish`, `verification_failed`, `no_verification_command`.
- A spec/plan **review FAIL** or a missing-subsystem REVISE (§2b step 5 / §3a).
- A wave that surfaced a **failure** — a `failed`/`blocked` task or a `blocking` review verdict (§2a
  step 4) — or **blocker re-engagement** after the CD-4 ladder fails its rungs.
- Re-entering an **in-progress brainstorm** (`resume_phase`, `phase==brainstorm`): continue / restart / stop.
- The §2-step-1 **multi-bundle discover picker**, and the bare-`finish` **pending-tasks** prompt
  (finalize anyway / keep working / `--retro-only`, §2c manual entry) — both genuine "which path?" forks.
- An explicit **risky-action** confirmation: push / merge / discard / force / external message / secrets.

**Explicitly forbidden** orchestrator-added asks (these ARE the over-asking the contract kills — never
emit them under loose/full):

<!-- cd9-exempt: this list QUOTES forbidden asks as anti-pattern examples to ban them; it does not emit them. -->

- "Run codex or not?" — routing is decided by `mp prepare-wave` (`routeTask`), never by asking.
- "What should I do next?" / "dispatch the next wave?" — between successful steps you **auto-proceed**:
  record digests → commit → dispatch the next wave **in the same turn** (§2a completion → re-decide).
- Per-small-task "looks good?" / "shall I continue?" confirmations.
- "Ready for Wave N" / "awaiting completion" / "status this turn:" ceremonial closers.

**Carve-out marker.** On an **auto-progress turn** — work done, re-decide returned a non-gate action
(`dispatch_wave` / `recover_and_redispatch` / `recover_plan_run` / `finalize_run` / `wait` / a committed
wave) and you are closing **without** an AUQ — end the turn's text with the literal token
**`<mp-autoprogress>`**. The global Stop guard
(`~/.claude/hooks/auq-guard.sh`) stands down when it sees this marker, so it won't force a ceremonial
AUQ onto an authorized autonomous turn. **Never** emit it on a turn that surfaces a stop-set gate (the
gate's own AUQ is the turn-close) or when `autonomy` is neither loose nor full. It is a stand-down
signal for *this plugin's* authorized auto-progress, mirroring the user-side `<no-auq>` hatch.

**Turn-close routing (CC-3-trampoline).** Every turn-close in this shell — a stop-set gate's AUQ, an
auto-progress `<mp-autoprogress>` close, or a plain stop — routes through the canonical
**CC-3-trampoline** sequence defined in `parts/step-0.md` (§ "CC-3-trampoline anchor"). That phase file
is the single enforcement point; this router only names the entry so the sequence is discoverable from
the orchestrator root rather than duplicated here.

## 3 — Other verbs (sequencing only — content lives elsewhere)

| verb | v8 target |
|---|---|
| `full` / `brainstorm` / `plan` | Locate the bundle, or **seed a new one** — `mp seed --state=<path> --slug=<slug> --topic="<topic>" [--complexity=… --autonomy=… --planning-mode=serial\|parallel\|auto --predecessor-transcript=…]` (writes a valid v8 brainstorm-phase bundle; refuses an existing one unless `--force`). **Brainstorm:** invoke `superpowers:brainstorming` directly; on spec approval, `mp set-phase --state=<path> --phase=plan` + `mp event --state=<path> --type=phase_transition --phase=plan` (never hand-edit `state.yml` — CD-7). **Plan:** hand to the **plan lifecycle (§3a)**, which selects serial vs parallel per `planning.mode`, then materializes `state.tasks` **and** advances `phase→execute` in one atomic `mp load-plan` write (the plan→execute seam; the lower-level `mp seed-tasks` populates tasks *without* touching phase, for recovering an already-`execute` bundle). The seam is guard-enforced: `mp set-phase --phase=execute` refuses a 0-task bundle without `--force`, and `decide` *throws* on a `phase:execute` + `tasks:[]` bundle rather than finalizing an unseeded run — so a bare `set-phase execute` can never silently archive a planned-but-unseeded run. Log other milestones with `mp event …`; gates via `mp open-gate` + an `AskUserQuestion`. (`brainstorm` stops once the plan phase is reached; `plan` runs §3a; `full` continues through execution via §2.) |
| `execute` | The resume controller (§2). |
| `finish` | The finalization verb → the flow in **§2c** (verify → retro → durable `branch_finish` gate → archive **LAST**). Bare `finish` = run §2c (on pending tasks, AUQ "finalize anyway / keep working / `--retro-only`" — never silent-archive an incomplete run). `finish --retro-only` = (re)generate `retro.md` only — no verification, no gate, no archive (the old `retro` behavior); safe on an in-progress or finished run, and it must NOT `set-status archived` (that would strand a run: the §2 discover filter hides archived bundles). |
| `retro` | Deprecated alias for `finish --retro-only`. Print a one-line "`retro` was renamed to `finish` (running `finish --retro-only`)" notice, then run it. Kept for muscle-memory/back-compat. |
| `import` | Legacy intake → a v8 bundle: `mp migrate-bundle` an in-place legacy `state.yml` (backs up the original). **On a pre-5.0 refusal the §2 step-2 rule applies: do NOT raw-rewrite `state.yml` (CD-7) — treat the legacy bundle as read-only and `mp seed` a fresh one, finish under v7, or stop and ask.** |
| `doctor` | `node "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/bin/doctor.mjs" [--fix]`. **[checks = step 5.]** |
| `status` | Read-only: `mp decide` (no writes) + a one-screen situation report from `state.yml`. **PR-aware** (PR probe ↓): if the branch has an open PR, append the `↪ Open PR #<n> …` line. |
| `validate` | Parse-check `state.yml` + config; report findings. No writes. |
| `stats` | `jq` roll-up over `events.jsonl` if present (replaces the v7 telemetry scripts). |
| `clean` | Archive (`mp set-status --state=<path> --status=archived`) / prune completed bundles. **PR-aware:** before archiving a bundle whose branch has an open PR, AUQ-**warn** (`bundle <slug>: branch has open PR #<n> — archive anyway?`) — warn, don't hard-block (archiving doesn't touch the PR; the user may still want the bundle gone). |
| `next` | `mp decide` → describe the next action without executing it. **PR-aware:** if the branch has an open PR, append the **advisory** `↪ Open PR #<n> ready — merge on GitHub or via /masterplan finish` (advisory only — never a `decide` action, never a blocking AUQ; this is how "a PR to merge" enters the what-do-I-do-next routine without becoming a per-resume nag). |
| `verbs` | Print the reserved-verb list above. |
| `publish` | **Lead → GitHub coordination** (§7.1 — spec §7). Preflight (`mp coord-status --fail-if-unpublishable`), then provision refs on first use (idempotent): synthesize/push the immutable contract ref `mp-coord/<slug>/<plan_hash>` (tier-1: `spec.md`/`plan.md`/`plan.index.json` only) via `git commit-tree` + `git update-ref` + `git push`; create the integration branch `mp-int/<slug>` from `base_sha` with the bundle dir excluded (`git commit-tree` on a tree that drops `docs/masterplan/<slug>/`) + `git push --no-verify`. Then compute unpublished tasks: read `coordination.issue_map` via `mp coord-status` (empty on first publish → all wave tasks are unpublished); for each unpublished task in the current wave: `gh issue create --title "T<id>: <title>" --body "$(mp gh-issue-body --task="$(jq -c '.tasks[]|select(.id==<id>)' plan.index.json)" --contract-ref=<ref> --integration-branch=<int-branch> --base-sha=<sha> --plan-hash=<hash> --wave=<N> --run-slug=<slug>)" --label "mp:run-<slug>,mp:wave-<N>,mp:open"` + `mp update-issue-map --task-id=<id> --issue=<n> --status=open --wave=<N> --state=<path>`. On unexpected duplicate (two issues, same key — `mp validate-claim`/gh-side `findDuplicates` backstop): fail loud, do NOT silently update. Pin `contract_ref` + `base_sha` into `state.coordination` **and record wave N as published** — `--mark-published` is what populates `published_waves`, which the next wave's `--fail-if-unpublishable` preflight gates on; omit it and the publish-advance guard silently no-ops — via `mp set-coord --state=<path> --wave=N --base-sha=<sha> --contract-ref=<ref> --integration-branch=<int-branch> --mark-published` + `mp event --state=<path> --type=wave_published --wave=N`. Commit the bundle. After follower PRs land, run `mp reconcile-integration --state=<path>`; for each `mark_done` action in the reconcile output, also call `mp update-issue-map --task-id=<id> --merge-sha=<sha> --status=merged --state=<path>`; surface reconcile actions via `AskUserQuestion` before applying. Publish wave N+1 only after wave N is fully merged (guard via `mp coord-status`). |
| `follow` | **Follower session → claim + deliver one task** (§7.1 — spec §7). 1. Preflight (`mp coord-status --fail-if-unconfigured`). 2. **Claim**: `issues="$(gh issue list --label "mp:open,mp:run-<slug>" --json number,title,body,labels,assignees --limit 200)"` → `mp select-claimable --plan-deps="$(jq -c '[.tasks[]|{key:(.id|tostring),value:.deps}]|from_entries' plan.index.json)" --issues="$issues"` to pick one; `gh issue edit <n> --add-assignee @me`; `gh label add mp:claimed`; re-read (`gh issue view <n> --json assignees,labels`) + `actor="$(gh api user --jq .login)"` + `mp validate-claim --actor="$actor"` → won/lost. On lost settle: release (`gh issue edit <n> --remove-assignee @me`; `gh label remove mp:claimed`; `gh label add mp:open`) and retry. 3. **Build**: fetch contract (`git fetch origin refs/mp-coord/<slug>/<plan_hash>:refs/mp-coord/<slug>/<plan_hash>`); create ephemeral bundle outside tracked `docs/masterplan/` (e.g. `.git/mp-coord/<slug>/t<id>/state.yml`) scoped to the single claimed task; cut branch `mp/<slug>/t<id>` from `mp-int/<slug>` at `base_sha`; resolve the implementer backend via `resolveImplementerBackend(task, config, env)` (config = `{ implementer: state.implementer ?? {} }`): `{kind:'agent'}` (the default — flag off, **identical to today**) → dispatch the existing `mp-implementer` agent; `{kind:'qctl'}` → **NotYetBound** (the qctl worker is not yet bound — design spec §A4/§5): comment the blocker on the issue, release the claim (`gh label remove mp:claimed`; `gh label add mp:open`), and surface the task as blocked — **never** silently fall back to `mp-implementer`. Then D6 `verify-scope` + `verify_commands`. 4. **Deliver**: on verify pass — `gh pr create --base mp-int/<slug> --head mp/<slug>/t<id> --title "T<id>: <title>" --body "Closes #<n>"` + `gh label remove mp:claimed` + `gh label add mp:pr-open`. On verify failure — comment on the issue (`gh issue comment <n> --body "Verify failed: <summary>"`); release the claim (`gh label remove mp:claimed`; `gh label add mp:open`). Discard the ephemeral bundle — the lead's canonical state.yml is the source of truth. |

**PR probe (`status` · `next` · `clean` — report-only, never auto-merge).** These three verbs check
for an open PR on the run's branch. Run **shell-side** (the established split — the shell owns git/`gh`,
`bin` is fs-only): resolve `branch` = `state.branch` or `git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD`, then
`gh pr list --head "<branch>" --state open --json number,title,mergeable,url 2>/dev/null` piped to
`mp pr-summary --gh-json='<output>'` → `{hasPr, number, title, url, mergeable}` (`mergeable ∈
yes|no|unknown` — GitHub computes it lazily, so a fresh PR reports `unknown`). `gh` is **best-effort**:
missing / unauthed / no remote / non-GitHub origin → empty → `{hasPr:false}` → no PR line, no error
(it must never break a read-only report). It is **report-only** — masterplan never auto-merges; a merge
happens only via the §2c `branch_finish` gate's Merge path or the user on GitHub. By design this lives
**only** in these human-invoked verbs (+ the §2c gate), **never** in the per-turn `decide` loop — a
"merge your PR" on every resume tick would be the exact over-asking nag the §2d contract kills.

## 3a — Plan lifecycle (serial | parallel — the `planning.mode` gate)

Reached when a bundle is in `phase=plan` with no plan yet: from §3's `full`/`plan` seed path (after
brainstorm's spec is approved and `mp set-phase plan` ran) and from §2's `resume_phase`. Selects
between the serial `superpowers:writing-plans` path and the parallel fan-out (§2b) per `planning.mode`.

1. **Resolve the mode.** `serial | parallel | auto`, from the `resume_phase` action's `planning_mode`
   (default `auto`); set at seed via `mp seed --planning-mode=…`.
2. **Decompose (unless `serial`).** For `parallel`/`auto`, dispatch `agents/mp-spec-decomposer` against
   `spec.md` → `{ subsystems, recommend_parallel, reason }`.
   - `parallel` → parallel branch (step 4) with this decomposition.
   - `auto` → parallel **iff** `recommend_parallel && subsystems.length ≥ 2`; otherwise serial (step 3).
     Carry the decomposer's `reason` into your narration.
   - `serial` → skip the decomposer → step 3.
3. **Serial path.** Dispatch the `masterplan:mp-planner` agent against the approved `spec.md` → it writes
   both `plan.md` and `plan.index.json` directly (sole producer). Gate it:
   `mp validate-plan-index --plan-index=<plan_index_path>` (on failure, fix and re-parse — never advance
   on an invalid index). Then **`mp load-plan --state=<path> --plan-index=<plan_index_path>`**
   (materializes `state.tasks` from the plan **and** advances `phase→execute` atomically — a bare
   `set-phase execute` would leave `tasks:[]` and the next `decide` would `complete`→archive the bundle)
   + `mp event --state=<path> --type=phase_transition --phase=execute`, commit, and hand to the resume
   controller (§2 → `dispatch_wave`).
4. **Parallel path.** Hand the decomposition to **§2b**'s plan launch (background fan-out → merge →
   validate → `mp-plan-reviewer` → execute). The phase advances to `execute` inside §2b's completion
   gate, not here.

Both paths converge on the same post-condition — a validated `plan.index.json` + `plan.md`, the
plan's tasks materialized into `state.tasks` and `phase=execute` (both via `mp load-plan`), committed
— after which §2 drives the wave loop.

## 4 — Turn-close (CD-9)

End any turn that needs input with `AskUserQuestion` (2–4 concrete options) — never a free-text
question (sessions compact between turns; a free-text prompt becomes a dead end) and never a silent
stop while a decision is pending. Completion is no longer a silent archive either — the §2c
finalization flow always surfaces the `branch_finish` gate (a risky-action AUQ) before archiving.

**Under `autonomy ∈ {loose, full}`, "needs input" means one of the §2d stop-set gates — nothing else.**
A turn that finished useful work but hit no gate **auto-progresses**: do the obvious next safe step in
the same turn (record → commit → dispatch the next wave) and close **without** an AUQ, ending the
text with the `<mp-autoprogress>` marker (§2d) so the global guard stands down. Do **not** manufacture a
"what next?" / "run codex?" / "Ready for Wave N" question — that over-asking is exactly what §2d forbids.
Reserve the AUQ for the genuine stop-set.

Otherwise close cleanly. What's gone from v7 is the *hook-driven per-turn* ceremony — trace
markers, breadcrumbs, and summary-block signals fired on every turn by Stop-hook machinery. v8
consolidates these into a single prompt-driven close: the **CC-3-trampoline anchor** in
`parts/step-0.md` (named at §2d "Turn-close routing"), which emits the summary block + exit
breadcrumb **once, at turn-close**, then closes with this AUQ at a stop-set gate. (The §0 version
banner is an *invocation*-time obligation — first, before anything — not part of turn-close.) That
anchor is the only ceremony that survives.
