## [0.1.0] — 2026-05-01

Initial release.

### Added
- `/superflow` slash command — orchestrates brainstorm → plan → execute via the superpowers skills.
- Subcommands: `import` (legacy artifact discovery + conversion), `doctor` (lint state across worktrees), `--resume=<path>` (resume a specific plan).
- Worktree-aware kickoff (Step B0): detects current state, recommends stay/use-existing/create-new with reasoned heuristics.
- Cross-worktree plan listing (Step A): scans every worktree of the current repo for in-progress plans.
- Configurable autonomy (`gated` / `loose` / `full`) per invocation, persisted in the status file.
- Self-paced cross-session loop scheduling via `ScheduleWakeup` when invoked under `/loop`.
- Codex routing toggle (`off` / `auto` / `manual`) with per-task eligibility heuristic and plan annotation overrides (`codex: ok` / `codex: no`).
- Completion-state inference for imported plans — multi-signal classifier (git log, filesystem, tests, checkboxes) with conservative classification.
- Status file format with worktree path, branch, autonomy, codex routing, and append-only activity log.
- `.superflow.yaml` configuration with three-tier precedence (CLI flags > repo-local > user-global > built-in).
- Context discipline rules (CD-1 through CD-10) mirroring the user's global execution style, threaded into the loop at high-leverage hook points.
- `superflow-detect` skill — surfaces a one-line suggestion to run `/superflow import` when legacy planning artifacts are detected. Never auto-runs the workflow.
- `superflow-retro` skill — generates a structured retrospective doc when a plan completes, with follow-up scheduling offers.
